0 Cerebellar implementation of movement sequences through feedback

Most movements are not unitary , but are comprised of sequences .
Although patients with cerebellar pathology display severe deficits in the execution and learning of sequences ( Doyon et al . , 1997; Shin and Ivry , 2003 ) , most of our understanding of cerebellar mechanisms has come from analyses of single component movements .
Eyelid conditioning is a cerebellar-mediated behavior that provides the ability to control and restrict inputs to the cerebellum through stimulation of mossy fibers .
We utilized this advantage to test directly how the cerebellum can learn a sequence of inter-connected movement components in rabbits .
We show that the feedback signals from one component are sufficient to serve as a cue for the next component in the sequence .
In vivo recordings from Purkinje cells demonstrated that all components of the sequence were encoded similarly by cerebellar cortex .
These results provide a simple yet general framework for how the cerebellum can use simple associate learning processes to chain together a sequence of appropriately timed responses .

Have you ever struggled to keep up with a sequence of movements, like a dance routine or exercise routine? People with issues in their cerebellum (a part of the brain) often have difficulty executing and learning these types of movements. However, most research on the cerebellum focuses on single movements rather than sequences. In this study, researchers used a behavior that only stimulates specific parts of the cerebellum to test how the cerebellum can learn and execute a sequence of movements in rabbits. They found that feedback from one movement is enough to cue the next movement, and that all components of the sequence are handled similarly by the cerebellar cortex. These findings offer a clear explanation for how the cerebellum can learn and execute sequences of movements.


1 Architecture of the human mTORC2 core complex

The mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) is a key protein kinase controlling cellular metabolism and growth .
It is part of the two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 .
Dysregulation of mTOR occurs in diabetes , cancer and neurological disease .
We report the architecture of human mTORC2 at intermediate resolution , revealing a conserved binding site for accessory proteins on mTOR and explaining the structural basis for the rapamycin insensitivity of the complex .

The protein called mTOR helps cells grow and handle energy in our bodies. It's made up of two groups of proteins, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which have different jobs. If mTOR doesn't work right, it can lead to diabetes, cancer, and brain problems. Scientists have figured out the shape of mTORC2 in humans, which shows how it connects to other proteins and helps explain why certain treatments don't work.


2 Motion along the mental number line reveals shared representations for numerosity and space

Perception of number and space are tightly intertwined .
It has been proposed that this is due to ‘cortical recycling’ , where numerosity processing takes over circuits originally processing space .
Do such ‘recycled’ circuits retain their original functionality ?
Here , we investigate interactions between numerosity and motion direction , two functions that both localize to parietal cortex .
We describe a new phenomenon in which visual motion direction adapts nonsymbolic numerosity perception , giving rise to a repulsive aftereffect: motion to the left adapts small numbers , leading to overestimation of numerosity , while motion to the right adapts large numbers , resulting in underestimation .
The reference frame of this effect is spatiotopic .
Together with the tuning properties of the effect this suggests that motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation may occur in a homolog of area LIP .
‘Cortical recycling’ thus expands but does not obliterate the functions originally performed by the recycled circuit , allowing for shared computations across domains .

Our ability to perceive numbers and space are closely connected in the brain. Scientists think this is because the circuits that process numbers may have taken over circuits that originally processed space. But do these "recycled" circuits still work the way they used to? 

In this study, researchers looked at how the brain processes two things: the number of objects we see and the direction of movement. They found that the way we perceive numbers can be influenced by the way objects are moving. When objects move to the left, we might overestimate the number of smaller objects we see. When objects move to the right, we might underestimate the number of larger objects we see. 

These findings suggest that our brains are able to adapt and share information between different areas, even if they originally had different functions. This helps us make sense of the world in different ways and solve problems in new and creative ways.


3 Allosteric inhibition of a stem cell RNA-binding protein by an intermediary metabolite

Gene expression and metabolism are coupled at numerous levels .
Cells must sense and respond to nutrients in their environment , and specialized cells must synthesize metabolic products required for their function .
Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of specialized cells .
How metabolic state contributes to stem cell differentiation is not understood .
In this study , we show that RNA-binding by the stem cell translation regulator Musashi-1 ( MSI1 ) is allosterically inhibited by 18–22 carbon ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acids .
The fatty acid binds to the N-terminal RNA Recognition Motif ( RRM ) and induces a conformational change that prevents RNA association .
Musashi proteins are critical for development of the brain , blood , and epithelium .
We identify stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 as a MSI1 target , revealing a feedback loop between ω-9 fatty acid biosynthesis and MSI1 activity .
We propose that other RRM proteins could act as metabolite sensors to couple gene expression changes to physiological state .

Our study investigates how stem cells, which have the ability to become any type of specialized cell in the body, are affected by the food we eat. We found that a fatty acid common in foods, called omega-9, can actually inhibit a protein called Musashi-1, which helps regulate stem cell development. Musashi-1 is important for the growth of many organs, including the brain and blood. We also discovered a link between this fatty acid and the production of another molecule important for metabolism. These findings suggest that the cells in our body can sense the nutrients we consume, and use this information to control how our genes are expressed.


4 Synaptotagmin 7 functions as a Ca2+-sensor for synaptic vesicle replenishment

Synaptotagmin ( syt ) 7 is one of three syt isoforms found in all metazoans; it is ubiquitously expressed , yet its function in neurons remains obscure .
Here , we resolved Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent synaptic vesicle ( SV ) replenishment pathways , and found that syt 7 plays a selective and critical role in the Ca2+-dependent pathway .
Mutations that disrupt Ca2+-binding to syt 7 abolish this function , suggesting that syt 7 functions as a Ca2+-sensor for replenishment .
The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin ( CaM ) has also been implicated in SV replenishment , and we found that loss of syt 7 was phenocopied by a CaM antagonist .
Moreover , we discovered that syt 7 binds to CaM in a highly specific and Ca2+-dependent manner; this interaction requires intact Ca2+-binding sites within syt 7 .
Together , these data indicate that a complex of two conserved Ca2+-binding proteins , syt 7 and CaM , serve as a key regulator of SV replenishment in presynaptic nerve terminals .

This study looked at a protein called synaptotagmin 7, which is found in all animals. Even though it's found all over the body, scientists didn't know what it does in the brain. The researchers found that this protein plays an important role in helping nerve cells replenish special little packages called synaptic vesicles. They also discovered that it works together with another protein called calmodulin. This complex of proteins is essential for keeping the brain functioning properly.


5 Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition reduces stress-induced affective pathology

Mood and anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions and are exacerbated by stress .
Recent studies have suggested cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibition could represent a novel treatment approach or augmentation strategy for affective disorders including anxiety disorders and major depression .
We show that traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor ( SSCI ) reduce a variety of stress-induced behavioral pathologies in mice .
We found that these behavioral effects were associated with a dampening of neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) ex vivo and in vivo , and were mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium ( SK ) channel and CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation .
Taken together , these data provide further support for the potential utility of SSCIs , as well as traditional COX-2 inhibitors , as novel treatment approaches for stress-related psychiatric disorders .

Mood and anxiety disorders are common mental health conditions that can be made worse by stress. Recent studies suggest that a new type of medication called COX-2 inhibitors could be helpful in treating these conditions. We conducted tests on mice and found that both traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a new kind called SSCI were able to reduce stress-induced behaviors. This was because they helped to calm down the parts of the brain that are responsible for fear and anxiety. Our findings suggest that these medications could be valuable treatments for people with stress-related mental health issues.


6 The Peptidisc, a simple method for stabilizing membrane proteins in detergent-free solution

Membrane proteins are difficult to work with due to their insolubility in aqueous solution and quite often their poor stability in detergent micelles .
Here , we present the peptidisc for their facile capture into water-soluble particles .
Unlike the nanodisc , which requires scaffold proteins of different lengths and precise amounts of matching lipids , reconstitution of detergent solubilized proteins in peptidisc only requires a short amphipathic bi-helical peptide ( NSPr ) and no extra lipids .
Multiple copies of the peptide wrap around to shield the membrane-exposed part of the target protein .
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this ‘one size fits all’ method using five different membrane protein assemblies ( MalFGK2 , FhuA , SecYEG , OmpF , BRC ) during ‘on-column’ , ‘in-gel’ , and ‘on-bead’ reconstitution embedded within the membrane protein purification protocol .
The peptidisc method is rapid and cost-effective , and it may emerge as a universal tool for high-throughput stabilization of membrane proteins to advance modern biological studies .

Membrane proteins are tricky to study because they don't dissolve well in water and often fall apart in detergents. But we've come up with a new way to make them cooperate! Our invention, called the peptidisc, makes it easy to turn difficult membrane proteins into water-friendly particles. Unlike other methods that require complicated ingredients, the peptidisc only needs a simple peptide. This peptide wraps around the protein to protect it and keep it stable. We tried the peptidisc method on five different membrane proteins and it worked great each time, whether we were working with the proteins on a column, in a gel, or on a bead. Our new method is fast and affordable, and it could become a go-to tool for scientists studying membrane proteins.


7 Universally high transcript error rates in bacteria

Errors can occur at any level during the replication and transcription of genetic information .
Genetic mutations derived mainly from replication errors have been extensively studied .
However , fundamental details of transcript errors , such as their rate , molecular spectrum , and functional effects , remain largely unknown .
To globally identify transcript errors , we applied an adapted rolling-circle sequencing approach to Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis , Agrobacterium tumefaciens , and Mesoplasma florum , revealing transcript-error rates 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding genetic mutation rates .
The majority of detected errors would result in amino-acid changes , if translated .
With errors identified from 9929 loci , the molecular spectrum and distribution of errors were uncovered in great detail .
A G→A substitution bias was observed in M . florum , which apparently has an error-prone RNA polymerase .
Surprisingly , an increased frequency of nonsense errors towards the 3′ end of mRNAs was observed , suggesting a Nonsense-Mediated Decay-like quality-control mechanism in prokaryotes .

Genetic mutations can happen when our cells copy and read our DNA. Scientists have studied these mutations a lot, but we don't know much about errors that happen when our cells read our DNA. To learn more, scientists looked at bacteria and found that there are a lot of errors when they read DNA to make proteins. These errors could lead to changes in the proteins that the bacteria make. The scientists also found that these errors happen more often than genetic mutations. They also found that there is a pattern to where the errors happen in the DNA. One of the bacteria they studied had more RNA errors than the others, which suggests that its cells are more likely to make mistakes when reading DNA. Lastly, the scientists also noticed that the errors tend to happen more towards the end of the DNA, which could be a way for the cells to check for mistakes.


8 Deprivation-related and use-dependent plasticity go hand in hand

Arm-amputation involves two powerful drivers for brain plasticity—sensory deprivation and altered use .
However , research has largely focused on sensory deprivation and maladaptive change .
Here we show that adaptive patterns of limb usage after amputation drive cortical plasticity .
We report that individuals with congenital or acquired limb-absence vary in whether they preferentially use their intact hand or residual arm in daily activities .
Using fMRI , we show that the deprived sensorimotor cortex is employed by whichever limb individuals are over-using .
Individuals from either group that rely more on their intact hands ( and report less frequent residual arm usage ) showed increased intact hand representation in the deprived cortex , and increased white matter fractional anisotropy underlying the deprived cortex , irrespective of the age at which deprivation occurred .
Our results demonstrate how experience-driven plasticity in the human brain can transcend boundaries that have been thought to limit reorganisation after sensory deprivation in adults .

Losing an arm can be a life-changing event, but our brains are adaptable and can adjust to this new situation. This is because when we lose a limb, our brain is deprived of sensory input and has to adjust to this change. Previous research has focused on this sensory deprivation, but our study shows that how we use our remaining arm can also affect brain function. We found that people who use their remaining arm more in daily activities showed changes in the part of the brain that controls movement, even if they lost their arm at a young age. Our results show that the brain can continue to adapt even after an limb amputation, and that we can train ourselves to use our remaining arm in a more effective way.


9 New light shed on the early evolution of limb-bone growth plate and bone marrow

The production of blood cells ( haematopoiesis ) occurs in the limb bones of most tetrapods but is absent in the fin bones of ray-finned fish .
When did long bones start producing blood cells ?
Recent hypotheses suggested that haematopoiesis migrated into long bones prior to the water-to-land transition and protected newly-produced blood cells from harsher environmental conditions .
However , little fossil evidence to support these hypotheses has been provided so far .
Observations of the humeral microarchitecture of stem-tetrapods , batrachians , and amniotes were performed using classical sectioning and three-dimensional synchrotron virtual histology .
They show that Permian tetrapods seem to be among the first to exhibit a centralised marrow organisation , which allows haematopoiesis as in extant amniotes .
Not only does our study demonstrate that long-bone haematopoiesis was probably not an exaptation to the water-to-land transition but it sheds light on the early evolution of limb-bone development and the sequence of bone-marrow functional acquisitions .

This study looked at how animals make blood cells. Most animals have bone that makes blood cells, except for fish with fins. Scientists used special imaging to study the bones of animals that lived a long time ago. They found that animals that lived a long time ago had bones that made blood cells too. This helps us understand how animals evolved and how their bones develop.


10 Alcohol drinking alters stress response to predator odor via BNST kappa opioid receptor signaling in male mice

Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder , but the mechanisms that underlie this are not well characterized .
Here , we show that kappa opioid receptor signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) is a critical molecular substrate underlying abnormal stress responses to predator odor following heavy alcohol drinking .
Exposure to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in enhanced prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) -driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST .
Furthermore , deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC-BNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice .
These findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal .
Various nodes of this PFC-BNST dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking .

Simply put, alcohol use disorder often causes people to react poorly to stress. We found that a specific area in the brain called the BNST, and a molecule called kappa opioid receptor signaling, play a big role in this. When mice were exposed to predator odor after heavy alcohol drinking, they had abnormal responses. We discovered that the PFC-BNST circuit is responsible for this abnormal response, and inhibiting this circuit can help restore normal behavior. These findings could lead to potential treatments for negative reactions to stress caused by heavy drinking.


11 The translation elongation factor eEF1A1 couples transcription to translation during heat shock response

Translation elongation factor eEF1A has a well-defined role in protein synthesis .
In this study , we demonstrate a new role for eEF1A: it participates in the entire process of the heat shock response ( HSR ) in mammalian cells from transcription through translation .
Upon stress , isoform 1 of eEF1A rapidly activates transcription of HSP70 by recruiting the master regulator HSF1 to its promoter .
eEF1A1 then associates with elongating RNA polymerase II and the 3′UTR of HSP70 mRNA , stabilizing it and facilitating its transport from the nucleus to active ribosomes .
eEF1A1-depleted cells exhibit severely impaired HSR and compromised thermotolerance .
In contrast , tissue-specific isoform 2 of eEF1A does not support HSR .
By adjusting transcriptional yield to translational needs , eEF1A1 renders HSR rapid , robust , and highly selective; thus , representing an attractive therapeutic target for numerous conditions associated with disrupted protein homeostasis , ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer .

Scientists have discovered that a protein called eEF1A has an important role in how our cells respond to heat stress. It was previously known for its role in making proteins, but it turns out that it also helps activate a gene called HSP70 that protects cells from heat damage. The protein helps move the gene's instructions out of the nucleus and into the ribosomes, where they can be turned into the protective protein. When there isn't enough eEF1A, cells have a harder time responding to heat and can be damaged more easily. Because of its important role, scientists are hoping to find ways to target eEF1A to help treat diseases where proteins aren't being made properly, like neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.


12 Auxin-regulated chromatin switch directs acquisition of flower primordium founder fate

Reprogramming of cell identities during development frequently requires changes in the chromatin state that need to be restricted to the correct cell populations .
Here we identify an auxin hormone-regulated chromatin state switch that directs reprogramming from transit amplifying to primordium founder cell fate in Arabidopsis inflorescences .
Upon auxin sensing , the MONOPTEROS transcription factor recruits SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPases to increase accessibility of the DNA for induction of key regulators of flower primordium initiation .
In the absence of the hormonal cue , auxin sensitive Aux/IAA proteins bound to MONOPTEROS block recruitment of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPases in addition to recruiting a co-repressor/histone deacetylase complex .
This simple and elegant hormone-mediated chromatin state switch is ideally suited for iterative flower primordium initiation and orchestrates additional auxin-regulated cell fate transitions .
Our findings establish a new paradigm for nuclear response to auxin .
They also provide an explanation for how this small molecule can direct diverse plant responses .

The way cells transform during growth requires certain changes in their physical makeup that should happen only in certain groups of cells. We've found a chemical switch regulated by hormones that directs this transformation in a flower called Arabidopsis. When this hormone is sensed, a protein called MONOPTEROS brings other proteins to loosen the DNA for the transformation to take place. Without the hormone, other proteins block this process. This discovery creates a new way of understanding how plants respond to chemicals, and how they create different types of cells.


13 Functional evidence implicating chromosome 7q22 haploinsufficiency in myelodysplastic syndrome pathogenesis

Chromosome 7 deletions are highly prevalent in myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and likely contribute to aberrant growth through haploinsufficiency .
We generated mice with a heterozygous germ line deletion of a 2-Mb interval of chromosome band 5A3 syntenic to a commonly deleted segment of human 7q22 and show that mutant hematopoietic cells exhibit cardinal features of MDS .
Specifically , the long-term hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) compartment is expanded in 5A3+/del mice , and the distribution of myeloid progenitors is altered .
5A3+/del HSCs are defective for lymphoid repopulating potential and show a myeloid lineage output bias .
These cell autonomous abnormalities are exacerbated by physiologic aging and upon serial transplantation .
The 5A3 deletion partially rescues defective repopulation in Gata2 mutant mice .
5A3+/del hematopoietic cells exhibit decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes , increased levels of reactive oxygen species , and perturbed oxygen consumption .
These studies provide the first functional data linking 7q22 deletions to MDS pathogenesis .

A chromosome problem called Chromosome 7 deletions is very common in a type of blood cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This problem likely leads to abnormal cell growth. Scientists made mice with a similar problem, and found they also developed features of MDS. The cells in the mice had trouble making different types of blood cells and had problems with their energy production. This helps us understand how MDS works and could lead to new treatments.


14 Transcriptional profiling at whole population and single cell levels reveals somatosensory neuron molecular diversity

The somatosensory nervous system is critical for the organism's ability to respond to mechanical , thermal , and nociceptive stimuli .
Somatosensory neurons are functionally and anatomically diverse but their molecular profiles are not well-defined .
Here , we used transcriptional profiling to analyze the detailed molecular signatures of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) sensory neurons .
We used two mouse reporter lines and surface IB4 labeling to purify three major non-overlapping classes of neurons:
1 ) IB4+SNS-Cre/TdTomato+ ,
2 ) IB4−SNS-Cre/TdTomato+ , and
3 ) Parv-Cre/TdTomato+ cells , encompassing the majority of nociceptive , pruriceptive , and proprioceptive neurons .
These neurons displayed distinct expression patterns of ion channels , transcription factors , and GPCRs .
Highly parallel qRT-PCR analysis of 334 single neurons selected by membership of the three populations demonstrated further diversity , with unbiased clustering analysis identifying six distinct subgroups .
These data significantly increase our knowledge of the molecular identities of known DRG populations and uncover potentially novel subsets , revealing the complexity and diversity of those neurons underlying somatosensation .

The somatosensory nervous system is an important part of our body that helps us feel touch, heat, and pain. Scientists have been studying this system to learn more about the different types of neurons that make it up. In this study, they used a technique called transcriptional profiling to get a better understanding of how these neurons work. They identified three main groups of neurons and found that they each have their own unique patterns of genes that control how they function. By studying these neurons in more detail, the researchers were able to discover even more diversity among them. This study helps us understand the complex nature of our sense of touch and how it is processed in our nervous system.


15 A compartmentalized signaling network mediates crossover control in meiosis

During meiosis , each pair of homologous chromosomes typically undergoes at least one crossover ( crossover assurance ) , but these exchanges are strictly limited in number and widely spaced along chromosomes ( crossover interference ) .
The molecular basis for this chromosome-wide regulation remains mysterious .
A family of meiotic RING finger proteins has been implicated in crossover regulation across eukaryotes .
Caenorhabditis elegans expresses four such proteins , of which one ( ZHP-3 ) is known to be required for crossovers .
Here we investigate the functions of ZHP-1 , ZHP-2 , and ZHP-4 .
We find that all four ZHP proteins , like their homologs in other species , localize to the synaptonemal complex , an unusual , liquid crystalline compartment that assembles between paired homologs .
Together they promote accumulation of pro-crossover factors , including ZHP-3 and ZHP-4 , at a single recombination intermediate , thereby patterning exchanges along paired chromosomes .
These proteins also act at the top of a hierarchical , symmetry-breaking process that enables crossovers to direct accurate chromosome segregation .

During the process of meiosis, the way in which pairs of chromosomes swap genetic information is strictly controlled. However, the way in which this control happens is not fully understood. Scientists have found a family of proteins that are linked to this process in many organisms, including C. elegans. In particular, one protein called ZHP-3 has been found to be essential for this process to happen. This study looked at three other related proteins, ZHP-1, ZHP-2, and ZHP-4. The researchers found that all four of these proteins work together to help control the swapping of genetic information, and that they do this in a part of the cell called the synaptonemal complex. They also found that these proteins are important for making sure that chromosome swapping happens in an orderly way, which is critical for healthy cell development.


16 Ordered dephosphorylation initiated by the selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives mitotic exit

APC/C-mediated proteolysis of cyclin B and securin promotes anaphase entry , inactivating CDK1 and permitting chromosome segregation , respectively .
Reduction of CDK1 activity relieves inhibition of the CDK1-counteracting phosphatases PP1 and PP2A-B55 , allowing wide-spread dephosphorylation of substrates .
Meanwhile , continued APC/C activity promotes proteolysis of other mitotic regulators .
Together , these activities orchestrate a complex series of events during mitotic exit .
However , the relative importance of regulated proteolysis and dephosphorylation in dictating the order and timing of these events remains unclear .
Using high temporal-resolution proteomics , we compare the relative extent of proteolysis and protein dephosphorylation .
This reveals highly-selective rapid proteolysis of cyclin B , securin and geminin at the metaphase-anaphase transition , followed by slow proteolysis of other substrates .
Dephosphorylation requires APC/C-dependent destruction of cyclin B and was resolved into PP1-dependent categories with unique sequence motifs .
We conclude that dephosphorylation initiated by selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives the bulk of changes observed during mitotic exit .

In simple terms, our research looks at how cells divide and the proteins involved in this process. We discovered that two important proteins called cyclin B and securin are broken down quickly at a specific time during cell division, which helps the process along. This breakdown also allows other proteins to be dephosphorylated, which is a key part of cell division. Our findings show that this breakdown process is really important for cells to divide properly.


17 Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex moderate stress induced depressive behaviors

Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is a prevalent illness that can be precipitated by acute or chronic stress .
Studies of patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers have identified Wfs1 mutations as causative for MDD .
The medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) is known to be involved in depression and behavioral resilience , although the cell types and circuits in the mPFC that moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress have not been determined .
Here , we report that deletion of Wfs1 from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells impairs the ability of the mPFC to suppress stress-induced depressive behaviors , and results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and altered accumulation of important growth and neurotrophic factors .
Our data identify superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as critical for moderation of stress in the context of depressive behaviors and suggest that dysfunction in these cells may contribute to the clinical relationship between stress and depression .

Depression is a common mental health condition caused by stress. Researchers have discovered that a gene mutation called Wfs1 can also play a role in depression. The part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in depression, but we don't know exactly how it works. This study found that a certain type of brain cell called layer 2/3 pyramidal cells are important in controlling how stress affects depression. When the Wfs1 gene is removed from these cells, it can cause hyperactivity and changes in important brain chemicals. This research helps us better understand how stress and depression are related.


18 Controlling protein function by fine-tuning conformational flexibility

In a living cell , protein function is regulated in several ways , including post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) , protein-protein interaction , or by the global environment ( e . g . crowding or phase separation ) .
While site-specific PTMs act very locally on the protein , specific protein interactions typically affect larger ( sub- ) domains , and global changes affect the whole protein non-specifically .
Herein , we directly observe protein regulation under three different degrees of localization , and present the effects on the Hsp90 chaperone system at the levels of conformational steady states , kinetics and protein function .
Interestingly using single-molecule FRET , we find that similar functional and conformational steady states are caused by completely different underlying kinetics .
We disentangle specific and non-specific effects that control Hsp90’s ATPase function , which has remained a puzzle up to now .
Lastly , we introduce a new mechanistic concept: functional stimulation through conformational confinement .
Our results demonstrate how cellular protein regulation works by fine-tuning the conformational state space of proteins .

Proteins are super important in cells, but they need to be regulated in order to work properly. This can happen in a few different ways - either by changing specific parts of the protein, by interacting with other proteins, or by the environment around the cell. In this study, we looked at the regulation of a particular protein called Hsp90. We found that even small changes in how the protein is regulated can have big effects on how it works. We figured out a new way that this regulation might happen, and our results help us understand more about how cells work.


19 Role of competition between polarity sites in establishing a unique front

Polarity establishment in many cells is thought to occur via positive feedback that reinforces even tiny asymmetries in polarity protein distribution .
Cdc42 and related GTPases are activated and accumulate in a patch of the cortex that defines the front of the cell .
Positive feedback enables spontaneous polarization triggered by stochastic fluctuations , but as such fluctuations can occur at multiple locations , how do cells ensure that they make only one front ?
In polarizing cells of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , positive feedback can trigger growth of several Cdc42 clusters at the same time , but this multi-cluster stage rapidly evolves to a single-cluster state , which then promotes bud emergence .
By manipulating polarity protein dynamics , we show that resolution of multi-cluster intermediates occurs through a greedy competition between clusters to recruit and retain polarity proteins from a shared intracellular pool .

When cells grow and divide, they need to establish a front and back end. Scientists have found that cells use positive feedback to create even tiny asymmetries in proteins that help with this process. They have also discovered that a protein called Cdc42 is important in determining the front of the cell. Sometimes cells can accidentally create more than one front, which is not good for growth and division. However, researchers have observed that in yeast cells, multiple fronts can turn into one quickly, allowing for proper cell division and growth. They found that this process occurs through a competition between protein clusters to attract and keep the proteins they need from a shared pool within the cell.


20 RecA filament sliding on DNA facilitates homology search

During homologous recombination , RecA forms a helical filament on a single stranded ( ss ) DNA that searches for a homologous double stranded ( ds ) DNA and catalyzes the exchange of complementary base pairs to form a new heteroduplex .
Using single molecule fluorescence imaging tools with high spatiotemporal resolution we characterized the encounter complex between the RecA filament and dsDNA .
We present evidence in support of the ‘sliding model’ wherein a RecA filament diffuses along a dsDNA track .
We further show that homology can be detected during sliding .
Sliding occurs with a diffusion coefficient of approximately 8000 bp2/s allowing the filament to sample several hundred base pairs before dissociation .
Modeling suggests that sliding can accelerate homology search by as much as 200 fold .
Homology recognition can occur for as few as 6 nt of complementary basepairs with the recognition efficiency increasing for higher complementarity .
Our data represents the first example of a DNA bound multi-protein complex which can slide along another DNA to facilitate target search .

Homologous recombination is a way that cells can repair their DNA. It involves a protein called RecA that forms a long, spiral structure on a single strand of DNA. This structure then looks for a matching double-stranded piece of DNA, and helps to swap some of the DNA "letters" between the two strands. Scientists have been studying how RecA does this, using a special microscope that lets them watch individual molecules of DNA and proteins. They found that the RecA structure can slide along the double-stranded DNA, and can even detect if the two strands match up. This sliding movement helps the RecA structure search for a match much more quickly than if it were just sticking in one place, and the researchers estimate that it could speed up the search by 200 times! Even if only a few of the DNA "letters" match up, the RecA structure can recognize that it's found a potential partner. Overall, this study is the first to show that a group of proteins can slide along DNA to find a match, which is an important process for repairing damaged DNA.


21 Drastic changes in conformational dynamics of the antiterminator M2-1 regulate transcription efficiency in Pneumovirinae

The M2-1 protein of human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) is a zinc-binding transcription antiterminator which is highly conserved among pneumoviruses .
We report the structure of tetrameric HMPV M2-1 .
Each protomer features a N-terminal zinc finger domain and an α-helical tetramerization motif forming a rigid unit , followed by a flexible linker and an α-helical core domain .
The tetramer is asymmetric , three of the protomers exhibiting a closed conformation , and one an open conformation .
Molecular dynamics simulations and SAXS demonstrate a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations in solution .
Structures of adenosine monophosphate- and DNA- bound M2-1 establish the role of the zinc finger domain in base-specific recognition of RNA .
Binding to ‘gene end’ RNA sequences stabilized the closed conformation of M2-1 leading to a drastic shift in the conformational landscape of M2-1 .
We propose a model for recognition of gene end signals and discuss the implications of these findings for transcriptional regulation in pneumoviruses .

We studied a protein called M2-1 that is found in human metapneumovirus and other similar viruses. We found that M2-1 has a specific part that can bind to zinc, and it forms a special shape with four identical parts. Using some fancy techniques, we can see that three of the parts are tightly locked together, and one is more flexible. M2-1 can also stick to special types of genetic material and help control how certain parts of the virus's genes get turned on or off. Our observations help explain how this protein works and could lead to new ways to treat infections caused by these viruses.


22 High lumenal chloride in the lysosome is critical for lysosome function

Lysosomes are organelles responsible for the breakdown and recycling of cellular machinery .
Dysfunctional lysosomes give rise to lysosomal storage disorders as well as common neurodegenerative diseases .
Here , we use a DNA-based , fluorescent chloride reporter to measure lysosomal chloride in Caenorhabditis elegans as well as murine and human cell culture models of lysosomal diseases .
We find that the lysosome is highly enriched in chloride , and that chloride reduction correlates directly with a loss in the degradative function of the lysosome .
In nematodes and mammalian cell culture models of diverse lysosomal disorders , where previously only lysosomal pH dysregulation has been described , massive reduction of lumenal chloride is observed that is ~103 fold greater than the accompanying pH change .
Reducing chloride within the lysosome impacts Ca2+ release from the lysosome and impedes the activity of specific lysosomal enzymes indicating a broader role for chloride in lysosomal function .

Lysosomes are like tiny recycling centers inside our cells. When they don't work right, it can cause diseases that affect the brain and other parts of the body. Scientists used a special tool to measure how much a certain chemical called chloride is inside lysosomes. They found that chloride is very important for lysosomes to work properly. In animals and cells with lysosomal diseases, the amount of chloride in lysosomes is way lower than normal. This affects how other important chemical reactions happen inside the lysosome, which could be causing the diseases.


23 Disparate substrates for head gaze following and face perception in the monkey superior temporal sulcus

Primates use gaze cues to follow peer gaze to an object of joint attention .
Gaze following of monkeys is largely determined by head or face orientation .
We used fMRI in rhesus monkeys to identify brain regions underlying head gaze following and to assess their relationship to the ‘face patch’ system , the latter being the likely source of information on face orientation .
We trained monkeys to locate targets by either following head gaze or using a learned association of face identity with the same targets .
Head gaze following activated a distinct region in the posterior STS , close to-albeit not overlapping with-the medial face patch delineated by passive viewing of faces .
This ‘gaze following patch’ may be the substrate of the geometrical calculations needed to translate information on head orientation from the face patches into precise shifts of attention , taking the spatial relationship of the two interacting agents into account .

Monkeys use eye movements to follow where their peers are looking. This ability to follow gaze is mostly based on the direction of the head or face. Scientists studied the brains of monkeys using a special kind of scan called fMRI. They found that there is a specific part of the brain that is activated when monkeys follow head movements called the 'gaze following patch'. This area of the brain helps the monkeys to figure out where to look next by calculating the position and movement of the other monkey's head. This finding helps us understand how primates use their eyes to communicate with each other.


24 Sensory experience during locomotion promotes recovery of function in adult visual cortex

Recovery from sensory deprivation is slow and incomplete in adult visual cortex .
In this study , we show that visual stimulation during locomotion , which increases the gain of visual responses in primary visual cortex , dramatically enhances recovery in the mouse .
Excitatory neurons regained normal levels of response , while narrow-spiking ( inhibitory ) neurons remained less active .
Visual stimulation or locomotion alone did not enhance recovery .
Responses to the particular visual stimuli viewed by the animal during locomotion recovered , while those to another normally effective stimulus did not , suggesting that locomotion promotes the recovery only of the neural circuits that are activated concurrent with the locomotion .
These findings may provide an avenue for improving recovery from amblyopia in humans .

When our senses are deprived, it can be hard for them to fully recover. But researchers have found a new way to speed up and improve this process in mice. By stimulating their vision while they move around, the mice were able to regain normal levels of response in their visual cortex. Only the neurons activated during this movement were affected, so it's not a full solution for all types of deprivation recovery. However, this could be a promising avenue for future research on improving vision recovery in humans.


25 Proteomics reveals synergy between biomass degrading enzymes and inorganic Fenton chemistry in leaf-cutting ant colonies

The symbiotic partnership between leaf-cutting ants and fungal cultivars processes plant biomass via ant fecal fluid mixed with chewed plant substrate before fungal degradation .
Here we present a full proteome of the fecal fluid of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants , showing that most proteins function as biomass degrading enzymes and that ca .
85% are produced by the fungus and ingested , but not digested , by the ants .
Hydrogen peroxide producing oxidoreductases were remarkably common in the proteome , inspiring us to test a scenario in which hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron to form reactive oxygen radicals after which oxidized iron is reduced by other fecal-fluid enzymes .
Our biochemical assays confirmed that these so-called Fenton reactions do indeed take place in special substrate pellets , presumably to degrade plant cell wall polymers .
This implies that the symbiotic partnership manages a combination of oxidative and enzymatic biomass degradation , an achievement that surpasses current human bioconversion technology .

Leaf-cutting ants and fungi work together to break down plant matter, using a mixture of ant poop and chewed-up plants. We looked at the proteins in the ant poop and found that most of them are enzymes that break down the plant material. Interestingly, 85% of these enzymes come from the fungus that the ants eat and pass through their system undigested. We also found that some of the proteins in the poop can create hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with iron to break down even more plant material. This partnership between ants and fungi is really good at breaking down plants in a way that humans can't match yet.


26 Greatwall promotes cell transformation by hyperactivating AKT in human malignancies

The PP2A phosphatase is often inactivated in cancer and is considered as a tumour suppressor .
A new pathway controlling PP2A activity in mitosis has been recently described .
This pathway includes the Greatwall ( GWL ) kinase and its substrates endosulfines .
At mitotic entry , GWL is activated and phosphorylates endosulfines that then bind and inhibit PP2A .
We analysed whether GWL overexpression could participate in cancer development .
We show that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation and increases invasive capacities of cells through hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase AKT .
Interestingly , AKT hyperphosphorylation induced by GWL is independent of endosulfines .
Rather , GWL induces GSK3 kinase dephosphorylation in its inhibitory sites and subsequent SCF-dependent degradation of the PHLPP phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation .
In line with its oncogenic activity , we find that GWL is often overexpressed in human colorectal tumoral tissues .
Thus , GWL is a human oncoprotein that promotes the hyperactivation of AKT via the degradation of its phosphatase , PHLPP , in human malignancies .

Scientists have discovered a new pathway in the body that controls a protein called PP2A, which helps prevent tumors from forming. This pathway involves a protein called Greatwall (GWL) and its helpers, endosulfines. When cells divide, GWL becomes active and stops PP2A from doing its job. Researchers looked to see if too much GWL could cause cancer. Their experiments showed that too much GWL can cause cells to become cancerous and spread. They found that GWL does this by making another protein called AKT too active. Importantly, they discovered that GWL does this by stopping another protein called PHLPP from doing its job, which normally keeps AKT in check. Scientists also found that GWL is found in high levels in colon cancer tumors. Thus, GWL is an oncoprotein that can promote cancer by making AKT extra-active through stopping its regulator, PHLPP.


27 The antibiotic bedaquiline activates host macrophage innate immune resistance to bacterial infection

Antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections .
Although known for their microbicidal activity , antibiotics may also interfere with the host’s immune system .
Here , we analyzed the effects of bedaquiline ( BDQ ) , an inhibitor of the mycobacterial ATP synthase , on human macrophages .
Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that BDQ reprogramed cells into potent bactericidal phagocytes .
We found that 579 and 1 , 495 genes were respectively differentially expressed in naive- and M . tuberculosis-infected macrophages incubated with the drug , with an over-representation of lysosome-associated genes .
BDQ treatment triggered a variety of antimicrobial defense mechanisms , including phagosome-lysosome fusion , and autophagy .
These effects were associated with activation of transcription factor EB , involved in the transcription of lysosomal genes , resulting in enhanced intracellular killing of different bacterial species that were naturally insensitive to BDQ .
Thus , BDQ could be used as a host-directed therapy against a wide range of bacterial infections .

Antibiotics are medicines we use to treat infections caused by bacteria. But did you know that they can also affect our own immune system? Scientists studied a new medicine called bedaquiline, which stops the growth of tuberculosis bacteria. They looked at how it affected special cells in our body called macrophages that help fight infections. What they found was really interesting! Bedaquiline made these cells even better at killing bacteria by turning on lots of genes related to destroying germs. This included genes that help the macrophages fuse with little sacs called lysosomes that can break down bacteria. Other genes helped the macrophages make enzymes that can eat away harmful bacteria, even those that bedaquiline itself cannot kill. Overall, this finding could open up new ways to treat many different kinds of bacterial infections!


28 YAP is essential for mechanical force production and epithelial cell proliferation during lung branching morphogenesis

Branching morphogenesis is a fundamental program for tissue patterning .
We show that active YAP , a key mediator of Hippo signaling , is distributed throughout the murine lung epithelium and loss of epithelial YAP severely disrupts branching .
Failure to branch is restricted to regions where YAP activity is removed .
This suggests that YAP controls local epithelial cell properties .
In support of this model , mechanical force production is compromised and cell proliferation is reduced in Yap mutant lungs .
We propose that defective force generation and insufficient epithelial cell number underlie the branching defects .
Through genomic analysis , we also uncovered a feedback control of pMLC levels , which is critical for mechanical force production , likely through the direct induction of multiple regulators by YAP .
Our work provides a molecular pathway that could control epithelial cell properties required for proper morphogenetic movement and pattern formation .

The growth of organs and tissues in our body is controlled by a program called branching morphogenesis. We found that a molecule called YAP, which helps cells communicate with each other, plays a critical role in this process in the lungs of mice. When we removed YAP from certain cells, the lung tissue didn't branch properly. We think YAP controls the properties of individual cells and their ability to produce mechanical force and divide. We also discovered that YAP affects the levels of another molecule called pMLC, which is important for generating force. Our research gives us a better understanding of how cells work together to form complex tissues and organs.


29 In situ structural analysis of the Yersinia enterocolitica injectisome

Injectisomes are multi-protein transmembrane machines allowing pathogenic bacteria to inject effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells , a process called type III secretion .
Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella flexneri injectisomes in situ and the first structural analysis of the Yersinia injectisome .
Unexpectedly , basal bodies of injectisomes inside the bacterial cells showed length variations of 20% .
The in situ structures of the Y . enterocolitica and S . flexneri injectisomes had similar dimensions and were significantly longer than the isolated structures of related injectisomes .
The crystal structure of the inner membrane injectisome component YscD appeared elongated compared to a homologous protein , and molecular dynamics simulations documented its elongation elasticity .
The ring-shaped secretin YscC at the outer membrane was stretched by 30–40% in situ , compared to its isolated liposome-embedded conformation .
We suggest that elasticity is critical for some two-membrane spanning protein complexes to cope with variations in the intermembrane distance .

Researchers have discovered a complex machine called the injectisome that allows harmful bacteria to inject a toxin into our cells, causing illness. By using advanced imaging techniques, the scientists were able to see, for the first time, the 3D structure of the injectisomes inside the bacterial cells. They were surprised to find that the injectisomes varied in length by up to 20%. Interestingly, the injectisomes were longer when they were inside the bacteria than when they were isolated. The scientists also identified key components of the injectisome that have the ability to stretch and change shape, allowing the machine to adapt to different conditions. This flexibility may be important for the injectisomes to function properly and cause infection.


30 Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins as chaperones and co-receptors for FERONIA receptor kinase signaling in Arabidopsis

The Arabidopsis receptor kinase FERONIA ( FER ) is a multifunctional regulator for plant growth and reproduction .
Here we report that the female gametophyte-expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein ( GPI-AP ) LORELEI and the seedling-expressed LRE-like GPI-AP1 ( LLG1 ) bind to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of FER and show that this interaction is pivotal for FER function .
LLG1 interacts with FER in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell surface , and loss of LLG1 function induces cytoplasmic retention of FER , consistent with transport of FER from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in a complex with LLG1 .
We further demonstrate that LLG1 is a component of the FER-regulated RHO GTPase signaling complex and that fer and llg1 mutants display indistinguishable growth , developmental and signaling phenotypes , analogous to how lre and fer share similar reproductive defects .
Together our results support LLG1/LRE acting as a chaperone and co-receptor for FER and elucidate a mechanism by which GPI-APs enable the signaling capacity of a cell surface receptor .

Scientists have discovered that a protein in plants called FERONIA plays a vital role in plant growth and reproduction. They also found that two other proteins called LORELEI and LLG1 interact with FERONIA, which is crucial for FERONIA to work properly. LLG1 helps transport FERONIA from one part of the cell to another and is also involved in signaling that regulates plant growth and development. The researchers found that when LLG1 doesn't function properly, plants have similar reproductive defects as when FERONIA doesn't work properly. These findings reveal new insights about the important role that these proteins play in plant biology.


31 Chromatin is an ancient innovation conserved between Archaea and Eukarya

The eukaryotic nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin , comprising a protein octamer that wraps ∼147 bp of DNA and has essential roles in DNA compaction , replication and gene expression .
Nucleosomes and chromatin have historically been considered to be unique to eukaryotes , yet studies of select archaea have identified homologs of histone proteins that assemble into tetrameric nucleosomes .
Here we report the first archaeal genome-wide nucleosome occupancy map , as observed in the halophile Haloferax volcanii .
Nucleosome occupancy was compared with gene expression by compiling a comprehensive transcriptome of Hfx .
volcanii .
We found that archaeal transcripts possess hallmarks of eukaryotic chromatin structure: nucleosome-depleted regions at transcriptional start sites and conserved −1 and +1 promoter nucleosomes .
Our observations demonstrate that histones and chromatin architecture evolved before the divergence of Archaea and Eukarya , suggesting that the fundamental role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression is ancient .

Scientists have long believed that the nucleosome - a basic building block of DNA - was unique to complex organisms. However, a recent study has found that simple organisms like archaea also have nucleosomes, and they're arranged in much the same way as in more complex life forms. Researchers created the first-ever map of nucleosome occupancy in archaea using a type of halophile called Haloferax volcanii. The team also compared levels of nucleosome density to gene expression and found that archaeal transcripts have similar patterns to those seen in eukaryotic organisms. This study suggests that the fundamental role of chromatin in gene expression regulation is ancient and evolved before life split into distinct branches.


32 Serotonin signaling mediates protein valuation and aging

Research into how protein restriction improves organismal health and lengthens lifespan has largely focused on cell-autonomous processes .
In certain instances , however , nutrient effects on lifespan are independent of consumption , leading us to test the hypothesis that central , cell non-autonomous processes are important protein restriction regulators .
We characterized a transient feeding preference for dietary protein after modest starvation in the fruit fly , Drosophila melanogaster , and identified tryptophan hydroxylase ( Trh ) , serotonin receptor 2a ( 5HT2a ) , and the solute carrier 7-family amino acid transporter , JhI-21 , as required for this preference through their role in establishing protein value .
Disruption of any one of these genes increased lifespan up to 90% independent of food intake suggesting the perceived value of dietary protein is a critical determinant of its effect on lifespan .
Evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory systems that define neural states of nutrient demand and reward are therefore sufficient to control aging and physiology independent of food consumption .

Scientists have been studying the effects of reducing protein consumption on health and lifespan. While most studies have focused on how this affects cells directly, some nutrients can affect lifespan regardless of how much is consumed. In fruit flies, we found that certain genes, including Trh, 5HT2a, and JhI-21, play a role in how protein is valued by the body. When these genes are disrupted, lifespan can increase up to 90%, even if total food intake remains the same. This shows that how the body perceives the value of protein is a key factor in its effect on lifespan. These findings suggest that the brain has a lot of control over aging and health, even without changes in diet.


33 Pervasive transcription read-through promotes aberrant expression of oncogenes and RNA chimeras in renal carcinoma

Aberrant expression of cancer genes and non-canonical RNA species is a hallmark of cancer .
However , the mechanisms driving such atypical gene expression programs are incompletely understood .
Here , our transcriptional profiling of a cohort of 50 primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) reveals that transcription read-through beyond the termination site is a source of transcriptome diversity in cancer cells .
Amongst the genes most frequently mutated in ccRCC , we identified SETD2 inactivation as a potent enhancer of transcription read-through .
We further show that invasion of neighbouring genes and generation of RNA chimeras are functional outcomes of transcription read-through .
We identified the BCL2 oncogene as one of such invaded genes and detected a novel chimera , the CTSC-RAB38 , in 20% of ccRCC samples .
Collectively , our data highlight a novel link between transcription read-through and aberrant expression of oncogenes and chimeric transcripts that is prevalent in cancer .

In cancer, genes and specific types of RNA can behave differently than they are supposed to. We already know this, but we don't fully understand why. This study looked at samples of a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and found that sometimes, the RNA keeps going after it's supposed to stop. This creates new types of RNA and can cause genes to act differently, which is a problem in cancer. They identified one gene called SETD2 that makes this happen more often in ccRCC and found a new type of RNA that is present in 20% of ccRCC samples. This research shows us a new way that genes can malfunction in cancer, which could lead to new ways of treating it.


34 The acidic domain of the endothelial membrane protein GPIHBP1 stabilizes lipoprotein lipase activity by preventing unfolding of its catalytic domain

GPIHBP1 is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of capillary endothelial cells that binds lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) within the interstitial space and shuttles it to the capillary lumen .
The LPL•GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing .
The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry , surface plasmon resonance , and zero-length cross-linking .
According to this model , GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: ( 1 ) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and ( 2 ) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol .
We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding .
Importantly , the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain .
This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia .

GPIHBP1 is a protein found in the walls of tiny blood vessels that plays an important role in processing fats in the body. When it teams up with another protein called LPL, the pair moves fats along the blood vessels, breaking them down into smaller molecules that can be used for energy. Scientists have now figured out how these two proteins work together, using special techniques to study their interactions. They found that different parts of GPIHBP1 play different roles in helping LPL do its job. This knowledge could eventually lead to new treatments for people with a rare genetic disorder that affects fat processing in the body.


35 E. coli TraR allosterically regulates transcription initiation by altering RNA polymerase conformation

TraR and its homolog DksA are bacterial proteins that regulate transcription initiation by binding directly to RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) rather than to promoter DNA .
Effects of TraR mimic the combined effects of DksA and its cofactor ppGpp , but the structural basis for regulation by these factors remains unclear .
Here , we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of Escherichia coli RNAP , with or without TraR , and of an RNAP-promoter complex .
TraR binding induced RNAP conformational changes not seen in previous crystallographic analyses , and a quantitative analysis revealed TraR-induced changes in RNAP conformational heterogeneity .
These changes involve mobile regions of RNAP affecting promoter DNA interactions , including the βlobe , the clamp , the bridge helix , and several lineage-specific insertions .
Using mutational approaches , we show that these structural changes , as well as effects on σ70 region 1 . 1 , are critical for transcription activation or inhibition , depending on the kinetic features of regulated promoters .

Researchers have discovered proteins in bacteria that control how genes are turned on and off. These proteins, called TraR and DksA, work by directly interacting with the machinery that reads and copies DNA, called RNA polymerase. When TraR is present, it can mimic the effects of DksA and another molecule called ppGpp. To investigate how TraR works, the scientists used a special imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy to look at the RNA polymerase complex in detail. They found that TraR causes changes in the shape of the RNA polymerase complex, which affects how it interacts with DNA at the site where a gene turns on. By making specific changes to the proteins, the researchers were able to control whether the genes were turned on or off. These findings may help scientists develop new ways to fight bacterial infections by interfering with gene regulation in harmful bacteria.


36 Hippocampus ghrelin signaling mediates appetite through lateral hypothalamic orexin pathways

Feeding behavior rarely occurs in direct response to metabolic deficit , yet the overwhelming majority of research on the biology of food intake control has focused on basic metabolic and homeostatic neurobiological substrates .
Most animals , including humans , have habitual feeding patterns in which meals are consumed based on learned and/or environmental factors .
Here we illuminate a novel neural system regulating higher-order aspects of feeding through which the gut-derived hormone ghrelin communicates with ventral hippocampus ( vHP ) neurons to stimulate meal-entrained conditioned appetite .
Additional results show that the lateral hypothalamus ( LHA ) is a critical downstream substrate for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia and that vHP ghrelin activated neurons communicate directly with neurons in the LHA that express the neuropeptide , orexin .
Furthermore , activation of downstream orexin-1 receptors is required for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia .
These findings reveal novel neurobiological circuitry regulating appetite through which ghrelin signaling in hippocampal neurons engages LHA orexin signaling .

When we eat, it's not always because our bodies need fuel. Our eating patterns are often influenced by things we've learned or our environment. Scientists have found a new way that the hormone ghrelin, which comes from the gut, communicates with the brain to stimulate appetite at specific times of day. This happens through a group of brain cells in the hippocampus and a neuropeptide called orexin in the hypothalamus. Understanding this circuit in the brain could help us better control our eating habits.


37 Using paired serology and surveillance data to quantify dengue transmission and control during a large outbreak in Fiji

Dengue is a major health burden , but it can be challenging to examine transmission and evaluate control measures because outbreaks depend on multiple factors , including human population structure , prior immunity and climate .
We combined population-representative paired sera collected before and after the 2013/14 dengue-3 outbreak in Fiji with surveillance data to determine how such factors influence transmission and control in island settings .
Our results suggested the 10–19 year-old age group had the highest risk of infection , but we did not find strong evidence that other demographic or environmental risk factors were linked to seroconversion .
A mathematical model jointly fitted to surveillance and serological data suggested that herd immunity and seasonally varying transmission could not explain observed dynamics .
However , the model showed evidence of an additional reduction in transmission coinciding with a vector clean-up campaign , which may have contributed to the decline in cases in the later stages of the outbreak .

Dengue is a disease that affects a lot of people, making it a big health problem. But it's hard to understand how it spreads and how to stop it because there are many different factors that can cause outbreaks. For example, how many people live in an area, how many have had dengue before, and what the climate is like can all play a role. 

We looked at blood samples from people in Fiji before and after a dengue outbreak in 2013 and 2014 to try to figure out how these different factors affect the spread of the disease. We found that the age group of 10 to 19 year olds was at the highest risk of getting sick, but we didn't see any strong links between other things like where people lived or the weather.

We used math to help us understand what was happening and found that having more people in a community who are already immune to dengue didn't seem to be enough to stop the disease from spreading. But we also saw that when people cleaned up the places where the insects that carry dengue like to live, the number of cases went down. This is important information that could help us control dengue in the future.


38 A tryparedoxin-coupled biosensor reveals a mitochondrial trypanothione metabolism in trypanosomes

Trypanosomes have a trypanothione redox metabolism that provides the reducing equivalents for numerous essential processes , most being mediated by tryparedoxin ( Tpx ) .
While the biosynthesis and reduction of trypanothione are cytosolic , the molecular basis of the thiol redox homeostasis in the single mitochondrion of these parasites has remained largely unknown .
Here we expressed Tpx-roGFP2 , roGFP2-hGrx1 or roGFP2 in either the cytosol or mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei .
We show that the novel Tpx-roGFP2 is a superior probe for the trypanothione redox couple and that the mitochondrial matrix harbors a trypanothione system .
Inhibition of trypanothione biosynthesis by the anti-trypanosomal drug Eflornithine impairs the ability of the cytosol and mitochondrion to cope with exogenous oxidative stresses , indicating a direct link between both thiol systems .
Tpx depletion abolishes the cytosolic , but only partially affects the mitochondrial sensor response to H2O2 .
This strongly suggests that the mitochondrion harbors some Tpx and , another , as yet unidentified , oxidoreductase .

Trypanosomes are tiny parasites that use a special chemical process called trypanothione redox metabolism to keep their essential processes going. This process relies on a molecule called tryparedoxin (Tpx). While trypanothione is made and used in the cells' cytoplasm, the way it works inside their single mitochondrion has not been well understood. In this study, scientists added special probes to the cells to investigate the mitochondrial trypanothione system. They found that inhibiting the production of trypanothione makes it harder for both the cytoplasm and mitochondria to deal with harmful oxygen molecules, and that mitochondria have their own Tpx system. The study suggests that trypanosomes might have another unknown process helping regulate the way oxygen affects their cells.


39 Epigenetic analysis of Paget’s disease of bone identifies differentially methylated loci that predict disease status

Paget’s disease of bone ( PDB ) is characterized by focal increases in disorganized bone remodeling .
This study aims to characterize PDB-associated changes in DNA methylation profiles in patients’ blood .
Meta-analysis of data from the discovery and cross-validation set , each comprising 116 PDB cases and 130 controls , revealed significant differences in DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites , 4 CpG islands , and 6 gene-body regions .
These loci , including two characterized as functional through expression quantitative trait-methylation analysis , were associated with functions related to osteoclast differentiation , mechanical loading , immune function , and viral infection .
A multivariate classifier based on discovery samples was found to discriminate PDB cases and controls from the cross-validation with a sensitivity of 0 . 84 , specificity of 0 . 81 , and an area under curve of 92 . 8% .
In conclusion , this study has shown for the first time that epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of PDB and may offer diagnostic markers for prediction of the disease .

Paget’s disease of bone is a condition where the body's bone remodeling process goes awry, resulting in abnormal bone growth. This study looked at changes in DNA methylation (a process that regulates gene expression) in the blood of patients with the disease. The study found differences in the DNA methylation at specific sites between patients with the disease and healthy individuals. These differences were linked to functions related to bone differentiation, immune function, and viral infection. The study also found that a combination of these differences could help diagnose the disease with high accuracy. This is the first study to show that changes in DNA methylation may contribute to the development of Paget’s disease of bone and could serve as a diagnostic tool in the future.


40 Dpp dependent Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to Hh dependent blood progenitors in larval lymph gland of Drosophila

Drosophila hematopoiesis bears striking resemblance with that of vertebrates , both in the context of distinct phases and the signaling molecules .
Even though , there has been no evidence of Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) in Drosophila , the larval lymph gland with its Hedgehog dependent progenitors served as an invertebrate model of progenitor biology .
Employing lineage-tracing analyses , we have now identified Notch expressing HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland .
Our studies clearly establish the hierarchical relationship between Notch expressing HSCs and the previously described Domeless expressing progenitors .
These HSCs require Decapentapelagic ( Dpp ) signal from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance in an identical manner to vertebrate aorta-gonadal-mesonephros ( AGM ) HSCs .
Thus , this study not only extends the conservation across these divergent taxa , but also provides a new model that can be exploited to gain better insight into the AGM related Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) .

Scientists have discovered new information about blood cells in fruit flies that could help us better understand blood cell formation in humans. Fruit fly blood cell formation has similar phases and signaling molecules to humans, but until now it was thought that fruit flies did not have hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Researchers have identified HSCs in the first stages of fruit fly development, which require a specific signal to stay healthy. This discovery not only expands our understanding of the similarities between fruit flies and humans, but also offers a new model for future studies.


41 A mammalian Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2 axis controls the cytoskeleton and confers cellular properties required for alveologenesis

Alveolar formation increases the surface area for gas-exchange and is key to the physiological function of the lung .
Alveolar epithelial cells , myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergo coordinated morphogenesis to generate epithelial folds ( secondary septa ) to form alveoli .
A mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete .
We found that the planar cell polarity ( PCP ) pathway is required in alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts for alveologenesis in mammals .
Our studies uncovered a Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2 cascade that endows cellular properties and novel mechanisms of alveologenesis .
This includes PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells , cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts .
All these cellular properties are conferred by changes in the cytoskeleton and represent a new facet of PCP function .
These results extend our current model of PCP signaling from polarizing a field of epithelial cells to conferring new properties at subcellular levels to regulate collective cell behavior .

The lungs are responsible for taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Alveoli are small sacs within the lungs that allow for gas exchange and are essential for proper lung function. Researchers are still trying to understand how alveoli are formed. Recent studies have found that a specific pathway called planar cell polarity (PCP) is required for proper alveolar formation in mammals. This pathway leads to changes in the behavior and shape of cells in the lungs, ultimately resulting in the formation of alveoli. These findings provide new insights into how the body creates and maintains healthy lungs.


42 Oxidation of cellular amino acid pools leads to cytotoxic mistranslation of the genetic code

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases use a variety of mechanisms to ensure fidelity of the genetic code and ultimately select the correct amino acids to be used in protein synthesis .
The physiological necessity of these quality control mechanisms in different environments remains unclear , as the cost vs benefit of accurate protein synthesis is difficult to predict .
We show that in Escherichia coli , a non-coded amino acid produced through oxidative damage is a significant threat to the accuracy of protein synthesis and must be cleared by phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase in order to prevent cellular toxicity caused by mis-synthesized proteins .
These findings demonstrate how stress can lead to the accumulation of non-canonical amino acids that must be excluded from the proteome in order to maintain cellular viability .

Scientists have discovered how cells ensure they make the right proteins and avoid toxic mistakes. A special set of enzymes, called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, help choose the right building blocks for proteins. However, it wasn't clear if these enzymes were always necessary. Now, researchers have found that in certain stressful situations, cells can make errors by using the wrong building blocks. This can cause damage to the cell. The study shows how cells have evolved to prevent these mistakes and protect themselves from harm.


43 A feedback mechanism converts individual cell features into a supracellular ECM structure in Drosophila trachea

The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , a structure contributed to and commonly shared by many cells in an organism , plays an active role during morphogenesis .
Here , we used the Drosophila tracheal system to study the complex relationship between the ECM and epithelial cells during development .
We show that there is an active feedback mechanism between the apical ECM ( aECM ) and the apical F-actin in tracheal cells .
Furthermore , we reveal that cell-cell junctions are key players in this aECM patterning and organisation and that individual cells contribute autonomously to their aECM .
Strikingly , changes in the aECM influence the levels of phosphorylated Src42A ( pSrc ) at cell junctions .
Therefore , we propose that Src42A phosphorylation levels provide a link for the ECM environment to ensure proper cytoskeletal organisation .

This study looks at the relationship between a structure called the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cells during development. We used the tracheal system of fruit flies to explore how cells influence the ECM and how the ECM affects cells. We found that there is a feedback system between the apical ECM and the apical F-actin in tracheal cells, and that cells work together to create a pattern in the ECM. We also discovered that changes in the ECM affect the way molecules are phosphorylated at cell junctions, which is a signal that helps cells organize their internal structures. This research shows how ECM plays an important role in helping cells develop properly.


44 Serial, parallel and hierarchical decision making in primates

The study of decision-making has mainly focused on isolated decisions where choices are associated with motor actions .
However , problem-solving often involves considering a hierarchy of sub-decisions .
In a recent study ( Lorteije et al . 2015 ) , we reported behavioral and neuronal evidence for hierarchical decision making in a task with a small decision tree .
We observed a first phase of parallel evidence integration for multiple sub-decisions , followed by a phase in which the overall strategy formed .
It has been suggested that a 'flat' competition between the ultimate motor actions might also explain these results .
A reanalysis of the data does not support the critical predictions of flat models .
We also examined the time-course of decision making in other , related tasks and report conditions where evidence integration for successive decisions is decoupled , which excludes flat models .
We conclude that the flexibility of decision-making implies that the strategies are genuinely hierarchical .

Scientists have been studying how people make decisions, and they have mainly focused on decisions where we physically do something. But when we solve more complicated problems, we often have to make a bunch of smaller decisions first. In a recent study, scientists looked at how we make these types of decisions. They found that our brains first gather evidence for each of the smaller decisions separately and then use that information to figure out the best strategy overall. Some people thought that our brains might just be picking between different actions without any real hierarchy, but the data didn't support that idea. The scientists also looked at other similar tasks and found that our brains always work in a hierarchical, step-by-step way. This shows that our brains are much more flexible than we thought!


45 Neural structure mapping in human probabilistic reward learning

Humans can learn abstract concepts that describe invariances over relational patterns in data .
One such concept , known as magnitude , allows stimuli to be compactly represented on a single dimension ( i . e . on a mental line ) .
Here , we measured representations of magnitude in humans by recording neural signals whilst they viewed symbolic numbers .
During a subsequent reward-guided learning task , the neural patterns elicited by novel complex visual images reflected their payout probability in a way that suggested they were encoded onto the same mental number line , with 'bad' bandits sharing neural representation with 'small' numbers and 'good' bandits with 'large' numbers .
Using neural network simulations , we provide a mechanistic model that explains our findings and shows how structural alignment can promote transfer learning .
Our findings suggest that in humans , learning about reward probability is accompanied by structural alignment of value representations with neural codes for the abstract concept of magnitude .

This study looked at how humans process numbers in their brains and how this influences learning. We found that people have a mental "number line" that allows them to easily understand the relative size of different numbers. During a test, we showed participants different symbols and recorded their brain activity. Later, we asked them to complete a task where they could win rewards, and found that their brain activity matched the payout probability in a way that was related to their mental number line. We used computer simulations to explain these findings and found that our brains align structural patterns to help us learn new things. These results suggest that our brains use the same neural codes to understand both numbers and rewards.


46 Single cell, super-resolution imaging reveals an acid pH-dependent conformational switch in SsrB regulates SPI-2

After Salmonella is phagocytosed , it resides in an acidic vacuole .
Its cytoplasm acidifies to pH 5 . 6; acidification activates pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI-2 ) .
SPI-2 encodes a type three secretion system whose effectors modify the vacuole , driving endosomal tubulation .
Using super-resolution imaging in single bacterial cells , we show that low pH induces expression of the SPI-2 SsrA/B signaling system .
Single particle tracking , atomic force microscopy , and single molecule unzipping assays identified pH-dependent stimulation of DNA binding by SsrB .
A so-called phosphomimetic form ( D56E ) was unable to bind to DNA in live cells .
Acid-dependent DNA binding was not intrinsic to regulators , as PhoP and OmpR binding was not pH-sensitive .
The low level of SPI-2 injectisomes observed in single cells is not due to fluctuating SsrB levels .
This work highlights the surprising role that acid pH plays in virulence and intracellular lifestyles of Salmonella; modifying acid survival pathways represents a target for inhibiting Salmonella .

This study looked at how Salmonella bacteria survive inside human cells. The bacteria live in a tiny compartment that is acidic, which activates a system they use to infect our cells. The researchers used really powerful microscopes to watch what happens to the bacteria in this acidic environment. They found that a certain protein in the bacteria is activated by the acid, allowing them to infect more cells. They also found that a certain form of the protein doesn't work properly in this acidic environment. The researchers think that targeting these acid survival pathways could be a way to stop Salmonella from causing illness.


47 RalB directly triggers invasion downstream Ras by mobilizing the Wave complex

The two Ral GTPases , RalA and RalB , have crucial roles downstream Ras oncoproteins in human cancers; in particular , RalB is involved in invasion and metastasis .
However , therapies targeting Ral signalling are not available yet .
By a novel optogenetic approach , we found that light-controlled activation of Ral at plasma-membrane promotes the recruitment of the Wave Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) via its effector exocyst , with consequent induction of protrusions and invasion .
We show that active Ras signals to RalB via two RalGEFs ( Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors ) , RGL1 and RGL2 , to foster invasiveness; RalB contribution appears to be more important than that of MAPK and PI3K pathways .
Moreover , on the clinical side , we uncovered a potential role of RalB in human breast cancers by determining that RalB expression at protein level increases in a manner consistent with progression toward metastasis .
This work highlights the Ras-RGL1/2-RalB-exocyst-WRC axis as appealing target for novel anticancer strategies .

Scientists have discovered that two proteins called RalA and RalB play important roles in the growth and spread of cancer cells. RalB is especially involved in the ability of cancer cells to invade and spread to other parts of the body. Unfortunately, there are currently no treatments that target these proteins. In a new study, researchers used a method called optogenetics to control the activity of RalB using light. They found that when RalB is activated, it promotes the formation of structures on the cancer cell surface that help the cells to invade nearby tissues. The researchers also discovered that RalB is activated by another cancer-related protein called Ras, which makes RalB even more important for cancer growth and spread than other pathways that are triggered by Ras. Finally, the researchers found that the amount of RalB protein in breast cancer cells increases as the cancer becomes more dangerous. These findings suggest that drugs that target RalB could be a promising strategy for treating cancer.


48 Side-binding proteins modulate actin filament dynamics

Actin filament dynamics govern many key physiological processes from cell motility to tissue morphogenesis .
A central feature of actin dynamics is the capacity of filaments to polymerize and depolymerize at their ends in response to cellular conditions .
It is currently thought that filament kinetics can be described by a single rate constant for each end .
In this study , using direct visualization of single actin filament elongation , we show that actin polymerization kinetics at both filament ends are strongly influenced by the binding of proteins to the lateral filament surface .
We also show that the pointed-end has a non-elongating state that dominates the observed filament kinetic asymmetry .
Estimates of flexibility as well as effects on fragmentation and growth suggest that the observed kinetic diversity arises from structural alteration .
Tuning elongation kinetics by exploiting the malleability of the filament structure may be a ubiquitous mechanism to generate a rich variety of cellular actin dynamics .

Actin is a protein that plays an important role in many physiological processes like cell movement and tissue development. Actin can create long, thin fibers called filaments that shrink and grow in response to the needs of the cell. Scientists used a special technique to watch actin filaments grow, and found out that small proteins that stick to the sides of the filaments can change how quickly they grow. They also found that one end of the filament doesn't grow as much as the other end. This difference in growth rate can be explained by changes in the structure of the filament. By understanding how actin filaments grow and change, researchers hope to learn more about how cells move and develop.


49 Single-molecule tracking of the transcription cycle by sub-second RNA detection

Transcription is an inherently stochastic , noisy , and multi-step process , in which fluctuations at every step can cause variations in RNA synthesis , and affect physiology and differentiation decisions in otherwise identical cells .
However , it has been an experimental challenge to directly link the stochastic events at the promoter to transcript production .
Here we established a fast fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fastFISH ) method that takes advantage of intrinsically unstructured nucleic acid sequences to achieve exceptionally fast rates of specific hybridization ( ∼10e7 M−1s−1 ) , and allows deterministic detection of single nascent transcripts .
Using a prototypical RNA polymerase , we demonstrated the use of fastFISH to measure the kinetic rates of promoter escape , elongation , and termination in one assay at the single-molecule level , at sub-second temporal resolution .
The principles of fastFISH design can be used to study stochasticity in gene regulation , to select targets for gene silencing , and to design nucleic acid nanostructures .

Did you know that the process of making RNA is unpredictable and can vary from cell to cell? Even in cells that are identical, tiny differences in RNA levels can have big impacts on their function. Scientists have developed a new method called fastFISH that can detect these differences quickly and accurately. It works by using special genetic sequences that bind to specific RNA molecules. This method will be useful in understanding how genes are regulated, and could help in designing new treatments for diseases.


50 A histone H3K9M mutation traps histone methyltransferase Clr4 to prevent heterochromatin spreading

Histone lysine-to-methionine ( K-to-M ) mutations are associated with multiple cancers , and they function in a dominant fashion to block the methylation of corresponding lysines on wild type histones .
However , their mechanisms of function are controversial .
Here we show that in fission yeast , introducing the K9M mutation into one of the three histone H3 genes dominantly blocks H3K9 methylation on wild type H3 across the genome .
In addition , H3K9M enhances the interaction of histone H3 tail with the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 in a SAM ( S-adenosyl-methionine ) -dependent manner , and Clr4 is trapped at nucleation sites to prevent its spreading and the formation of large heterochromatin domains .
We further determined the crystal structure of an H3K9M peptide in complex with human H3K9 methyltransferase G9a and SAM , which reveales that the methionine side chain had enhanced van der Waals interactions with G9a .
Therefore , our results provide a detailed mechanism by which H3K9M regulates H3K9 methylation .

Scientists have discovered a connection between mutations in certain genes, called histone lysine-to-methionine (K-to-M) mutations, and multiple types of cancer. These mutations act in a way that prevents the proper methylation of histones, which can lead to the formation of tumors. Researchers have been unsure of exactly how these mutations work, but recent studies on fission yeast have shed some light on the mechanism. Specifically, introducing the K9M mutation into one of the three histone H3 genes has been found to block H3K9 methylation across the genome, preventing the formation of large heterochromatin domains. This mutation also enhances the interaction between histone H3 and the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 in a biochemical process involving S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). Through crystal structure analysis, researchers have discovered the specific way in which the methionine side chain interacts with G9a, an important regulator of these processes. These findings will help scientists better understand how these mutations lead to cancer, and could eventually lead to new treatment options.


51 JMJD6 cleaves MePCE to release positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in higher eukaryotes

More than 30% of genes in higher eukaryotes are regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) .
Phosphorylation of Pol II CTD by positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ) is a necessary precursor event that enables productive transcription elongation .
The exact mechanism on how the sequestered P-TEFb is released from the 7SK snRNP complex and recruited to Pol II CTD remains unknown .
In this report , we utilize mouse and human models to reveal methylphosphate capping enzyme ( MePCE ) , a core component of the 7SK snRNP complex , as the cognate substrate for Jumonji domain-containing 6 ( JMJD6 ) ’s novel proteolytic function .
Our evidences consist of a crystal structure of JMJD6 bound to methyl-arginine , enzymatic assays of JMJD6 cleaving MePCE in vivo and in vitro , binding assays , and downstream effects of Jmjd6 knockout and overexpression on Pol II CTD phosphorylation .
We propose that JMJD6 assists bromodomain containing 4 ( BRD4 ) to recruit P-TEFb to Pol II CTD by disrupting the 7SK snRNP complex .

Scientists have discovered that more than 30% of genes in higher organisms are controlled by a process called "promoter-proximal pausing." For this process to work properly, a molecule called positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) needs to be activated by a series of chemical events. However, scientists don't fully understand how this activation process works. In this study, researchers investigated a specific enzyme called methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE) and its relationship to a molecule called Jumonji domain-containing 6 (JMJD6). Through experiments with mice and humans, they found that JMJD6 can break down MePCE and free up P-TEFb to help regulate genes. This research helps us understand how this important process works and could lead to new treatments for diseases caused by gene regulation problems.


52 ZCWPW1 is recruited to recombination hotspots by PRDM9 and is essential for meiotic double strand break repair

During meiosis , homologous chromosomes pair and recombine , enabling balanced segregation and generating genetic diversity .
In many vertebrates , double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) initiate recombination within hotspots where PRDM9 binds , and deposits H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 .
However , no protein ( s ) recognising this unique combination of histone marks have been identified .
We identified Zcwpw1 , containing H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 recognition domains , as having highly correlated expression with Prdm9 .
Here , we show that ZCWPW1 has co-evolved with PRDM9 and , in human cells , is strongly and specifically recruited to PRDM9 binding sites , with higher affinity than sites possessing H3K4me3 alone .
Surprisingly , ZCWPW1 also recognises CpG dinucleotides .
Male Zcwpw1 knockout mice show completely normal DSB positioning , but persistent DMC1 foci , severe DSB repair and synapsis defects , and downstream sterility .
Our findings suggest ZCWPW1 recognition of PRDM9-bound sites at DSB hotspots is critical for synapsis , and hence fertility .

During sex cell division, chromosomes pair up and swap genetic material with each other, creating variation in offspring. In many animals, this process is started by specific breaks in DNA strands, which are aided by a protein called PRDM9. However, scientists haven't found any proteins that can recognize the unique marks on PRDM9-bound DNA. In this study, researchers found a protein called Zcwpw1 that can recognize these marks and seems to have evolved along with PRDM9. Zcwpw1 is important for proper sex cell formation and fertility, as shown by experiments on mice that lack the gene.


53 Spen links RNA-mediated endogenous retrovirus silencing and X chromosome inactivation

The Xist lncRNA mediates X chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) .
Here we show that Spen , an Xist-binding repressor protein essential for XCI , binds to ancient retroviral RNA , performing a surveillance role to recruit chromatin silencing machinery to these parasitic loci .
Spen loss activates a subset of endogenous retroviral ( ERV ) elements in mouse embryonic stem cells , with gain of chromatin accessibility , active histone modifications , and ERV RNA transcription .
Spen binds directly to ERV RNAs that show structural similarity to the A-repeat of Xist , a region critical for Xist-mediated gene silencing .
ERV RNA and Xist A-repeat bind the RRM domains of Spen in a competitive manner .
Insertion of an ERV into an A-repeat deficient Xist rescues binding of Xist RNA to Spen and results in strictly local gene silencing in cis .
These results suggest that Xist may coopt transposable element RNA-protein interactions to repurpose powerful antiviral chromatin silencing machinery for sex chromosome dosage compensation .

The X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes and in females, one of the X chromosomes gets turned off to balance out the amount of genetic material with males who only have one X. Scientists have discovered a molecule called Xist that is responsible for this process. In this study, they found that another molecule called Spen helps Xist by recognizing and silencing old bits of viral DNA that have inserted themselves into the genome. Without Spen, these bits of DNA become active and can cause problems. Spen can recognize both the viral DNA and the part of Xist that is crucial for silencing genes, and these two molecules compete for Spen's attention. The researchers even showed that they could manipulate Xist to bind Spen and silence genes in a different part of the genome. By studying how these molecules work, we may learn how to better understand and treat conditions related to gene regulation.


54 Kinesin-4 KIF21B limits microtubule growth to allow rapid centrosome polarization in T cells

When a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell form an immunological synapse , rapid dynein-driven translocation of the centrosome toward the contact site leads to reorganization of microtubules and associated organelles .
Currently , little is known about how the regulation of microtubule dynamics contributes to this process .
Here , we show that the knockout of KIF21B , a kinesin-4 linked to autoimmune disorders , causes microtubule overgrowth and perturbs centrosome translocation .
KIF21B restricts microtubule length by inducing microtubule pausing typically followed by catastrophe .
Catastrophe induction with vinblastine prevented microtubule overgrowth and was sufficient to rescue centrosome polarization in KIF21B-knockout cells .
Biophysical simulations showed that a relatively small number of KIF21B molecules can restrict mirotubule length and promote an imbalance of dynein-mediated pulling forces that allows the centrosome to translocate past the nucleus .
We conclude that proper control of microtubule length is important for allowing rapid remodeling of the cytoskeleton and efficient T cell polarization .

When our immune system encounters a threat, specific cells called T cells need to quickly respond and attack the threat. This process requires a complex series of steps that begin with the T cell and another cell called an antigen-presenting cell coming into contact and forming an immunological synapse. This contact triggers the movement of the centrosome, an organelle made up of microtubules, towards the synapse, which helps reorganize other cellular components to prepare for the attack.

A recent study looked at how microtubules, a crucial component in this process, are regulated in this context. The study found that a protein called KIF21B helps control microtubule length, and when it's missing, microtubules become too long and the centrosome cannot move as efficiently towards the synapse. By adding a drug that triggers a process called catastrophe induction, the microtubules were brought back under control and the centrosome was able to move towards the synapse again. The study also showed that even a small amount of KIF21B is critical for this process.

In conclusion, this study reveals the importance of regulating microtubules during the immune response process. By better understanding these cellular processes, researchers hope to be able to develop new treatments for autoimmune disorders and other diseases.


55 Self-sperm induce resistance to the detrimental effects of sexual encounters with males in hermaphroditic nematodes

Sexual interactions have a potent influence on health in several species , including mammals .
Previous work in C . elegans identified strategies used by males to accelerate the demise of the opposite sex ( hermaphrodites ) .
But whether hermaphrodites evolved counter-strategies against males remains unknown .
Here we discover that young C . elegans hermaphrodites are remarkably resistant to brief sexual encounters with males , whereas older hermaphrodites succumb prematurely .
Surprisingly , it is not their youthfulness that protects young hermaphrodites , but the fact that they have self-sperm .
The beneficial effect of self-sperm is mediated by a sperm-sensing pathway acting on the soma rather than by fertilization .
Activation of this pathway in females triggers protection from the negative impact of males .
Interestingly , the role of self-sperm in protecting against the detrimental effects of males evolved independently in hermaphroditic nematodes .
Endogenous strategies to delay the negative effect of mating may represent a key evolutionary innovation to maximize reproductive success .

Sex can have a big impact on health in many different animals, including mammals. Scientists previously found that male worms can make female worms die faster after sex. However, they didn't know if female worms had ways to stop this from happening. In this study, researchers found that young female worms are really good at resisting the negative effects of sex with males, but older females can't handle it as well. The scientists were surprised to find out that having their own sperm helped protect the young female worms, but not by making babies. Instead, it was a signal that kept them safe. Even more interesting, other types of female worms also evolved this same strategy to protect themselves through sex. This discovery is important because it shows that there are ways to protect yourself from the negative effects of sex, and it might help animals have more babies.


56 Flexible nitrogen utilisation by the metabolic generalist pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Bacterial metabolism is fundamental to survival and pathogenesis .
We explore how Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilises amino acids as nitrogen sources , using a combination of bacterial physiology and stable isotope tracing coupled to mass spectrometry metabolomics methods .
Our results define core properties of the nitrogen metabolic network from M . tuberculosis , such as:
( i ) the lack of homeostatic control of certain amino acid pool sizes;
( ii ) similar rates of utilisation of different amino acids as sole nitrogen sources;
( iii ) improved nitrogen utilisation from amino acids compared to ammonium; and
( iv ) co-metabolism of nitrogen sources .
Finally , we discover that alanine dehydrogenase is involved in ammonium assimilation in M . tuberculosis , in addition to its essential role in alanine utilisation as a nitrogen source .
This study represents the first in-depth analysis of nitrogen source utilisation by M . tuberculosis and reveals a flexible metabolic network with characteristics that are likely a product of evolution in the human host .

We studied how a bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis survives and causes disease by using amino acids for nitrogen. We did this by using special techniques to investigate the bacteria's metabolism. Our findings show that the bacteria use different types of amino acids equally well, and they can use amino acids better than other nitrogen sources. We also discovered that a protein called alanine dehydrogenase helps the bacteria absorb nitrogen. This research is the first of its kind and gives us insight into how this harmful bacteria has evolved to survive in humans.


57 An oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α isoform inhibits Wnt signaling by destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex

Hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIFs ) , while best known for their roles in the hypoxic response , have oxygen-independent roles in early development with poorly defined mechanisms .
Here , we report a novel Hif-3α variant , Hif-3α2 , in zebrafish .
Hif-3α2 lacks the bHLH , PAS , PAC , and ODD domains , and is expressed in embryonic and adult tissues independently of oxygen availability .
Hif-3α2 is a nuclear protein with significant hypoxia response element ( HRE ) -dependent transcriptional activity .
Hif-3α2 overexpression not only decreases embryonic growth and developmental timing but also causes left-right asymmetry defects .
Genetic deletion of Hif-3α2 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing increases , while Hif-3α2 overexpression decreases , Wnt/β-catenin signaling .
This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity .
Mechanistically , Hif-3α2 binds to β-catenin and destabilizes the nuclear β-catenin complex .
This mechanism is distinct from GSK3β-mediated β-catenin degradation and is conserved in humans .
These findings provide new insights into the oxygen-independent actions of HIFs and uncover a novel mechanism regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling .

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are proteins that help cells respond to low oxygen levels. We have discovered a new type of HIF, called Hif-3α2, in zebrafish. This new HIF works differently from other HIFs and is found in both early and adult zebrafish, regardless of how much oxygen is around. When we made zebrafish make more of the Hif-3α2 protein, the fish didn't grow properly and had strange asymmetry issues. We also found that Hif-3α2 can change how a kind of protein called Wnt/β-catenin works, but in a way that's not like other ways we've seen before. This discovery tells us more about how HIFs work in different situations and shows us a new way to control Wnt/β-catenin signaling in humans too.


58 Stem cell niche exit in C. elegans via orientation and segregation of daughter cells by a cryptic cell outside the niche

Stem cells reside in and rely upon their niche to maintain stemness but must balance self-renewal with the production of daughters that leave the niche to differentiate .
We discovered a mechanism of stem cell niche exit in the canonical C . elegans distal tip cell ( DTC ) germ stem cell niche mediated by previously unobserved , thin , membranous protrusions of the adjacent somatic gonad cell pair ( Sh1 ) .
A disproportionate number of germ cell divisions were observed at the DTC-Sh1 interface .
Stem-like and differentiating cell fates segregated across this boundary .
Spindles polarized , pairs of daughter cells oriented between the DTC and Sh1 , and Sh1 grew over the Sh1-facing daughter .
Impeding Sh1 growth by RNAi to cofilin and Arp2/3 perturbed the DTC-Sh1 interface , reduced germ cell proliferation , and shifted a differentiation marker .
Because Sh1 membrane protrusions eluded detection for decades , it is possible that similar structures actively regulate niche exit in other systems .

Our research found that stem cells rely on a specific environment to keep their unique properties, but they also need to produce cells that can change into different types. We looked at a specific group of cells in a worm and discovered a new way that stem cells can leave their environment to start turning into different cells. We noticed that the cells next to the stem cells send out small, thin extensions that help the stem cells divide and start moving away. When we stopped those extensions from growing, the stem cells didn't work as well and didn't turn into other cells as easily. This is important because we didn't know about these extensions before, and they could be important in other kinds of cells too.


59 Biomolecular interactions modulate macromolecular structure and dynamics in atomistic model of a bacterial cytoplasm

Biological macromolecules function in highly crowded cellular environments .
The structure and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids are well characterized in vitro , but in vivo crowding effects remain unclear .
Using molecular dynamics simulations of a comprehensive atomistic model cytoplasm we found that protein-protein interactions may destabilize native protein structures , whereas metabolite interactions may induce more compact states due to electrostatic screening .
Protein-protein interactions also resulted in significant variations in reduced macromolecular diffusion under crowded conditions , while metabolites exhibited significant two-dimensional surface diffusion and altered protein-ligand binding that may reduce the effective concentration of metabolites and ligands in vivo .
Metabolic enzymes showed weak non-specific association in cellular environments attributed to solvation and entropic effects .
These effects are expected to have broad implications for the in vivo functioning of biomolecules .
This work is a first step towards physically realistic in silico whole-cell models that connect molecular with cellular biology .

Biological molecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, work in very crowded environments inside cells. Scientists have studied how these molecules work in the lab, but it's not clear how they behave in the real world. Using computer models, researchers found that when proteins interact with each other, they can change shape and function. On the other hand, molecules that our bodies make naturally can help these proteins fold up into a more compact shape. This study could help scientists create computer models of cells that are more realistic and can help us understand how our bodies work.


60 Influenza-virus membrane fusion by cooperative fold-back of stochastically induced hemagglutinin intermediates

Influenza virus penetrates cells by fusion of viral and endosomal membranes catalyzed by the viral hemagglutinin ( HA ) .
Structures of the initial and final states of the HA trimer define the fusion endpoints , but do not specify intermediates .
We have characterized these transitions by analyzing low-pH-induced fusion kinetics of individual virions and validated the analysis by computer simulation .
We detect initial engagement with the target membrane of fusion peptides from independently triggered HAs within the larger virus-target contact patch; fusion then requires engagement of three or four neighboring HA trimers .
Effects of mutations in HA indicate that withdrawal of the fusion peptide from a pocket in the pre-fusion trimer is rate-limiting for both events , but the requirement for cooperative action of several HAs to bring the fusing membranes together leads to a long-lived intermediate state for single , extended HA trimers .
This intermediate is thus a fundamental aspect of the fusion mechanism .

When the flu virus tries to infect our cells, it needs to fuse its membrane with the cell's membrane. This is possible thanks to a viral protein called hemagglutinin (HA). Scientists have studied how this process happens and found that it involves different steps. They used experiments and computer simulations to observe the changes that occur in the HA protein as it helps the virus enter the cell. They discovered that multiple HA proteins need to work together to make this happen, and that there is a moment during this process when the membranes are not yet fused, but they are very close to each other. This moment is essential for the virus to enter the cell. Understanding these details is crucial for developing treatments and vaccines for the flu.


61 Sparse recurrent excitatory connectivity in the microcircuit of the adult mouse and human cortex

Generating a comprehensive description of cortical networks requires a large-scale , systematic approach .
To that end , we have begun a pipeline project using multipatch electrophysiology , supplemented with two-photon optogenetics , to characterize connectivity and synaptic signaling between classes of neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex ( V1 ) and human cortex .
We focus on producing results detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enabling comparison with future studies .
Here , we report our examination of intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons .
We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell classes and layers we sampled , and that most mouse synapses exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics .
Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons , however , exhibited facilitation .
These results contribute to a body of evidence describing recurrent excitatory connectivity as a conserved feature of cortical microcircuits .

In simpler terms, we are using advanced techniques to study how different groups of brain cells communicate with each other in mice and humans. Our goal is to understand these networks well enough to create computer models that can help us learn even more in the future. So far, we have found that connections between cells are not very common, but they do exist across different layers of the brain. We have also discovered that some types of signals between certain cells have unique patterns. Our findings tell us more about the ways brains are connected and how they work.


62 P1 interneurons promote a persistent internal state that enhances inter-male aggression in Drosophila

How brains are hardwired to produce aggressive behavior , and how aggression circuits are related to those that mediate courtship , is not well understood .
A large-scale screen for aggression-promoting neurons in Drosophila identified several independent hits that enhanced both inter-male aggression and courtship .
Genetic intersections revealed that 8-10 P1 interneurons , previously thought to exclusively control male courtship , were sufficient to promote fighting .
Optogenetic experiments indicated that P1 activation could promote aggression at a threshold below that required for wing extension .
P1 activation in the absence of wing extension triggered persistent aggression via an internal state that could endure for minutes .
High-frequency P1 activation promoted wing extension and suppressed aggression during photostimulation , whereas aggression resumed and wing extension was inhibited following photostimulation offset .
Thus , P1 neuron activation promotes a latent , internal state that facilitates aggression and courtship , and controls the overt expression of these social behaviors in a threshold-dependent , inverse manner .

Scientists have discovered new information about how the brain controls both aggressive behavior and courtship in male fruit flies. By studying neurons that promote aggression, they found that a small group of neurons that were previously thought to only control courtship are also responsible for promoting fighting. When these neurons were activated at just the right level, the flies became more aggressive but did not perform their courtship displays. Interestingly, turning off the activation caused the flies to remain aggressive for a few minutes even after the stimulus was removed. The researchers hope that this study can help us better understand how the brain controls social behavior in animals.


63 The genomic landscape of meiotic crossovers and gene conversions in Arabidopsis thaliana

Knowledge of the exact distribution of meiotic crossovers ( COs ) and gene conversions ( GCs ) is essential for understanding many aspects of population genetics and evolution , from haplotype structure and long-distance genetic linkage to the generation of new allelic variants of genes .
To this end , we resequenced the four products of 13 meiotic tetrads along with 10 doubled haploids derived from Arabidopsis thaliana hybrids .
GC detection through short reads has previously been confounded by genomic rearrangements .
Rigid filtering for misaligned reads allowed GC identification at high accuracy and revealed an ∼80-kb transposition , which undergoes copy-number changes mediated by meiotic recombination .
Non-crossover associated GCs were extremely rare most likely due to their short average length of ∼25–50 bp , which is significantly shorter than the length of CO-associated GCs .
Overall , recombination preferentially targeted non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters , which showed significant enrichment of two sequence motifs .

This study looked at how our genes change during the process of reproduction. We focused on a specific type of change called a crossover or gene conversion, which helps create new versions of genes. We studied a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana and found that these changes happen more often in certain parts of the DNA, called non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters. We also found a section of DNA that moves around and can change the number of copies it has, which could have important implications for how the plant evolves over time.


64 Fatigue induces long-lasting detrimental changes in motor-skill learning

Fatigue due to physical exertion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in everyday life and especially common in a range of neurological diseases .
While the effect of fatigue on limiting skill execution are well known , its influence on learning new skills is unclear .
This is of particular interest as it is common practice to train athletes , musicians or perform rehabilitation exercises up to and beyond a point of fatigue .
In a series of experiments , we describe how muscle fatigue , defined as degradation of maximum force after exertion , impairs motor-skill learning beyond its effects on task execution .
The negative effects on learning are evidenced by impaired task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue .
Further , we found that this effect is in part mediated centrally and can be alleviated by altering motor cortex function .
Thus , the common practice of training while , or beyond , fatigue levels should be carefully reconsidered , since this affects overall long-term skill learning .

We all know how tired we can get after physical activity, and this is especially true for people with neurological diseases. We know that feeling tired can make it harder to perform tasks we already know how to do, but we don't know how it affects our ability to learn new things. This is important because many athletes, musicians, and people in rehabilitation continue to train even when they're tired. In a bunch of experiments, we found that muscle fatigue (when your muscles get weaker after you use them a lot) makes it harder to learn new skills, even if you're not feeling tired anymore. We also found that this happens because of something happening in the brain, and that you may be able to stop it from happening by changing how your brain works. So if you want to get really good at something, you might want to think about taking a break when you're tired instead of pushing through it.


65 Rev7 and 53BP1/Crb2 prevent RecQ helicase-dependent hyper-resection of DNA double-strand breaks

Poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerase inhibitors ( PARPi ) target cancer cells deficient in homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .
In preclinical models , PARPi resistance is tied to altered nucleolytic processing ( resection ) at the 5’ ends of a DSB .
For example , loss of either 53BP1 or Rev7/MAD2L2/FANCV derepresses resection to drive PARPi resistance , although the mechanisms are poorly understood .
Long-range resection can be catalyzed by two machineries: the exonuclease Exo1 , or the combination of a RecQ helicase and Dna2 .
Here , we develop a single-cell microscopy assay that allows the distinct phases and machineries of resection to be interrogated simultaneously in living S . pombe cells .
Using this assay , we find that the 53BP1 orthologue and Rev7 specifically repress long-range resection through the RecQ helicase-dependent pathway , thereby preventing hyper-resection .
These results suggest that ‘rewiring’ of BRCA1-deficient cells to employ an Exo1-independent hyper-resection pathway is a driver of PARPi resistance .

Researchers are investigating a new approach to treating cancer using a group of drugs called PARPi. These drugs work by targeting cancer cells that are unable to repair certain types of damage to their DNA. However, some cancer cells can become resistant to PARPi, which limits their effectiveness. Scientists are studying the mechanisms by which resistance develops, and have found that a particular process called resection is involved. Cells can use two different machineries to perform resection, and it seems that one of these is more likely to lead to PARPi resistance. By studying this process in living cells, researchers hope to develop new ways to prevent resistance and make PARPi more effective against cancer.


66 Wild worm embryogenesis harbors ubiquitous polygenic modifier variation

Embryogenesis is an essential and stereotypic process that nevertheless evolves among species .
Its essentiality may favor the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation ( CGV ) that has no effect in the wild-type but that enhances or suppresses the effects of rare disruptions to gene function .
Here , we adapted a classical modifier screen to interrogate the alleles segregating in natural populations of Caenorhabditis elegans: we induced gene knockdowns and used quantitative genetic methodology to examine how segregating variants modify the penetrance of embryonic lethality .
Each perturbation revealed CGV , indicating that wild-type genomes harbor myriad genetic modifiers that may have little effect individually but which in aggregate can dramatically influence penetrance .
Phenotypes were mediated by many modifiers , indicating high polygenicity , but the alleles tend to act very specifically , indicating low pleiotropy .
Our findings demonstrate the extent of conditional functionality in complex trait architecture .

Embryogenesis is the process of how an embryo develops and grows into a living organism. Even though it is important, scientists have found that there are genetic differences that don't affect the embryo's development but can either make a problem worse or lessen its effects. Scientists studied these genetic differences in a type of roundworm and found that each individual difference might not have a big impact, but when taken together they could majorly affect embryonic development. These genetic differences tend to only influence one specific aspect of development instead of multiple things. This research shows how many tiny things work together to shape complex traits.


67 Metabolic interactions between dynamic bacterial subpopulations

Individual microbial species are known to occupy distinct metabolic niches within multi-species communities .
However , it has remained largely unclear whether metabolic specialization can similarly occur within a clonal bacterial population .
More specifically , it is not clear what functions such specialization could provide and how specialization could be coordinated dynamically .
Here , we show that exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations , including one population that produces acetate , and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin , a pH-neutral storage molecule .
These subpopulations exhibit distinct growth rates and dynamic interconversion between states .
Furthermore , acetate concentration influences the relative sizes of the different subpopulations .
These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic , environmentally-sensitive state-switching .

Microscopic organisms called bacteria can form groups with different specialized roles, just like how different people in a team have different jobs. It wasn't clear if this specialization could happen within a single type of bacteria, though. In this study, researchers found out that Bacillus subtilis bacteria can split into subgroups that each perform a different role - like making a chemical called acetate or storing another chemical called acetoin. These subgroups grow at different rates and can change their roles depending on the environment. This shows that even simple, single-celled organisms can work together and adapt to their surroundings to survive.


68 Recombination occurs within minutes of replication blockage by RTS1 producing restarted forks that are prone to collapse

The completion of genome duplication during the cell cycle is threatened by the presence of replication fork barriers ( RFBs ) .
Following collision with a RFB , replication proteins can dissociate from the stalled fork ( fork collapse ) rendering it incapable of further DNA synthesis unless recombination intervenes to restart replication .
We use time-lapse microscopy and genetic assays to show that recombination is initiated within ∼10 min of replication fork blockage at a site-specific barrier in fission yeast , leading to a restarted fork within ∼60 min , which is only prevented/curtailed by the arrival of the opposing replication fork .
The restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse causing hyper-recombination downstream of the barrier .
Surprisingly , in our system fork restart is unnecessary for maintaining cell viability .
Seemingly , the risk of failing to complete replication prior to mitosis is sufficient to warrant the induction of recombination even though it can cause deleterious genetic change .

During cell division, the copying of our DNA can be stopped by obstacles called replication fork barriers (RFBs). When this happens, our DNA replication machinery can shut down, and if it doesn’t restart, our cells can’t divide. We found that in a type of yeast, a repair process called recombination can kick in quickly after an RFB to restart the machinery and get the DNA copying again. The restarted machinery can still collapse, causing genetic changes, but surprisingly, we found that this repair process isn’t actually necessary for the yeast to stay healthy. However, the risk of failed replication is so great that the yeast activates it anyway.


69 Non-crossover gene conversions show strong GC bias and unexpected clustering in humans

Although the past decade has seen tremendous progress in our understanding of fine-scale recombination , little is known about non-crossover ( NCO ) gene conversion .
We report the first genome-wide study of NCO events in humans .
Using SNP array data from 98 meioses , we identified 103 sites affected by NCO , of which 50/52 were confirmed in sequence data .
Overlap with double strand break ( DSB ) hotspots indicates that most of the events are likely of meiotic origin .
We estimate that a site is involved in a NCO at a rate of 5 . 9 × 10−6/bp/generation , consistent with sperm-typing studies , and infer that tract lengths span at least an order of magnitude .
Observed NCO events show strong allelic bias at heterozygous AT/GC SNPs , with 68% ( 58–78% ) transmitting GC alleles ( p = 5 × 10−4 ) .
Strikingly , in 4 of 15 regions with resequencing data , multiple disjoint NCO tracts cluster in close proximity ( ∼20–30 kb ) , a phenomenon not previously seen in mammals .

Scientists have made progress in understanding how genetic material is exchanged during reproduction, but there is still much we don't know about a particular process called non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion. The first-ever genome-wide study of NCO events has now been conducted in humans, using data from 98 individuals. Through this analysis, researchers found that NCO events occur at a rate of 5.9x10^-6 per base pair per generation, and they can span a wide range of lengths. Interestingly, NCO events tend to favor certain types of genetic variation, and in some cases, multiple NCO events occur close together, which is a new finding. This work sheds light on a previously understudied aspect of reproduction and could inform future research on genetic diseases.


70 Mutational phospho-mimicry reveals a regulatory role for the XRCC4 and XLF C-terminal tails in modulating DNA bridging during classical non-homologous end joining

XRCC4 and DNA Ligase 4 ( LIG4 ) form a tight complex that provides DNA ligase activity for classical non-homologous end joining ( the predominant DNA double-strand break repair pathway in higher eukaryotes ) and is stimulated by XLF .
Independently of LIG4 , XLF also associates with XRCC4 to form filaments that bridge DNA .
These XRCC4/XLF complexes rapidly load and connect broken DNA , thereby stimulating intermolecular ligation .
XRCC4 and XLF both include disordered C-terminal tails that are functionally dispensable in isolation but are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage by DNA-PK and/or ATM .
Here we concomitantly modify the tails of XRCC4 and XLF by substituting fourteen previously identified phosphorylation sites with either alanine or aspartate residues .
These phospho-blocking and -mimicking mutations impact both the stability and DNA bridging capacity of XRCC4/XLF complexes , but without affecting their ability to stimulate LIG4 activity .
Implicit in this finding is that phosphorylation may regulate DNA bridging by XRCC4/XLF filaments .

Scientists have discovered a complex made up of XRCC4 and DNA Ligase 4 that helps repair broken DNA in our bodies. This complex is important because it is the main way that our cells fix DNA. Another protein called XLF also helps this complex, and we found out that XLF can make "bridges" that help the broken DNA get reconnected faster. We also learned that the tails of XRCC4 and XLF can be changed by a process called phosphorylation, which can help regulate their ability to bridge DNA. By modifying these tails in different ways, we found out that this complex can still repair DNA, but it may do it differently depending on how the tail is modified.


71 Cyclin Kinase-independent role of p21CDKN1A in the promotion of nascent DNA elongation in unstressed cells

The levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21 are low in S phase and insufficient to inhibit CDKs .
We show here that endogenous p21 , instead of being residual , it is functional and necessary to preserve the genomic stability of unstressed cells .
p21depletion slows down nascent DNA elongation , triggers permanent replication defects and promotes the instability of hard-to-replicate genomic regions , namely common fragile sites ( CFS ) .
The p21’s PCNA interacting region ( PIR ) , and not its CDK binding domain , is needed to prevent the replication defects and the genomic instability caused by p21 depletion .
The alternative polymerase kappa is accountable for such defects as they were not observed after simultaneous depletion of both p21 and polymerase kappa .
Hence , in CDK-independent manner , endogenous p21 prevents a type of genomic instability which is not triggered by endogenous DNA lesions but by a dysregulation in the DNA polymerase choice during genomic DNA synthesis .

Scientists have discovered that a molecule called p21 is important for keeping our genetic material stable. During a particular stage of cell growth called S phase, p21 levels are normally low and unable to do this job effectively. However, the researchers found that even at these low levels, p21 still plays an important role in preventing genetic errors from occurring in normal, healthy cells. When p21 levels were deliberately lowered, the cells experienced problems with replicating their DNA, which led to unstable regions in the genome known as common fragile sites. The researchers identified a specific part of the p21 molecule, called the PCNA interacting region, as being key to its protective function. They also discovered that another molecule called polymerase kappa is involved in this process. Overall, the findings suggest that p21 acts in a way that is independent of other molecules, to help keep our genetic material healthy and free from errors that could cause disease.


72 Structure of PINK1 and mechanisms of Parkinson's disease-associated mutations

Mutations in the human kinase PINK1 ( hPINK1 ) are associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease ( PD ) .
hPINK1 activates Parkin E3 ligase activity , involving phosphorylation of ubiquitin and the Parkin ubiquitin-like ( Ubl ) domain via as yet poorly understood mechanisms .
hPINK1 is unusual amongst kinases due to the presence of three loop insertions of unknown function .
We report the structure of Tribolium castaneum PINK1 ( TcPINK1 ) , revealing several unique extensions to the canonical protein kinase fold .
The third insertion , together with autophosphorylation at residue Ser205 , contributes to formation of a bowl-shaped binding site for ubiquitin .
We also define a novel structural element within the second insertion that is held together by a distal loop that is critical for TcPINK1 activity .
The structure of TcPINK1 explains how PD-linked mutations that lie within the kinase domain result in hPINK1 loss-of-function and provides a platform for the exploration of small molecule modulators of hPINK1 .

This study looks at a protein called hPINK1 that is linked to Parkinson's disease. The researchers were able to examine a similar protein in beetles and discovered some unique features in its structure. They found that hPINK1 helps activate another protein called Parkin, which is important in getting rid of damaged cells. Mutations in hPINK1 can cause it to stop working properly, which is associated with Parkinson's disease. By understanding the structure of this protein, scientists hope to develop new drugs to treat Parkinson's disease.


73 Contributions of mast cells and vasoactive products, leukotrienes and chymase, to dengue virus-induced vascular leakage

Dengue Virus ( DENV ) , a flavivirus spread by mosquito vectors , can cause vascular leakage and hemorrhaging .
However , the processes that underlie increased vascular permeability and pathological plasma leakage during viral hemorrhagic fevers are largely unknown .
Mast cells ( MCs ) are activated in vivo during DENV infection , and we show that this elevates systemic levels of their vasoactive products , including chymase , and promotes vascular leakage .
Treatment of infected animals with MC-stabilizing drugs or a leukotriene receptor antagonist restores vascular integrity during experimental DENV infection .
Validation of these findings using human clinical samples revealed a direct correlation between MC activation and DENV disease severity .
In humans , the MC-specific product , chymase , is a predictive biomarker distinguishing dengue fever ( DF ) and dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) .
Additionally , our findings reveal MCs as potential therapeutic targets to prevent DENV-induced vasculopathy , suggesting MC-stabilizing drugs should be evaluated for their effectiveness in improving disease outcomes during viral hemorrhagic fevers .

Dengue Virus (DENV) is a disease caused by mosquito bites. It can make your blood vessels leak and cause bleeding. But we don't know why this happens. Researchers found that a type of cell in our body, called mast cells, becomes active during DENV infection. This makes chemicals that cause blood vessels to leak. When they gave drugs to stop the mast cells from leaking, the blood vessels worked better in animals. Mast cells were also more active in people who were sicker with DENV. They found a chemical in mast cells that can tell if someone will have a mild or severe case of DENV. These findings suggest that stopping mast cells from leaking could be a good way to treat DENV and other viral hemorrhagic fevers.


74 Site-specific phosphorylation and caspase cleavage of GFAP are new markers of Alexander disease severity

Alexander disease ( AxD ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , which supports the structural integrity of astrocytes .
Over 70 GFAP missense mutations cause AxD , but the mechanism linking different mutations to disease-relevant phenotypes remains unknown .
We used AxD patient brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) -derived astrocytes to investigate the hypothesis that AxD-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) on GFAP .
Our findings reveal selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young , independently of the mutation they carried .
AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations , resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed in vivo .
Ser13 phosphorylation facilitated GFAP aggregation and was associated with increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6 .
Furthermore , caspase-6 was selectively expressed in young AxD patients , and correlated with the presence of cleaved GFAP .
We reveal a novel PTM signature linking different GFAP mutations in infantile AxD .

Alexander Disease is a deadly disease affecting the brain that is caused by changes in a protein called GFAP. These changes can happen in many different ways, but we don't understand exactly how they cause the disease. In this study, we looked at brain tissue from people with Alexander Disease and cells that we made in the laboratory to see how GFAP changes might be involved in the disease. We found that a particular change in GFAP is present in young people who died from the disease, no matter which type of change they had. This change makes the protein stick together and form aggregates, which are like clumps of GFAP inside cells. We also found that this change makes GFAP more vulnerable to being broken down by a protein called caspase-6. This protein is also more common in young people with the disease. Overall, we have found a new way that different GFAP changes are linked to Alexander Disease in young patients.


75 Using mobile phones as acoustic sensors for high-throughput mosquito surveillance

The direct monitoring of mosquito populations in field settings is a crucial input for shaping appropriate and timely control measures for mosquito-borne diseases .
Here , we demonstrate that commercially available mobile phones are a powerful tool for acoustically mapping mosquito species distributions worldwide .
We show that even low-cost mobile phones with very basic functionality are capable of sensitively acquiring acoustic data on species-specific mosquito wingbeat sounds , while simultaneously recording the time and location of the human-mosquito encounter .
We survey a wide range of medically important mosquito species , to quantitatively demonstrate how acoustic recordings supported by spatio-temporal metadata enable rapid , non-invasive species identification .
As proof-of-concept , we carry out field demonstrations where minimally-trained users map local mosquitoes using their personal phones .
Thus , we establish a new paradigm for mosquito surveillance that takes advantage of the existing global mobile network infrastructure , to enable continuous and large-scale data acquisition in resource-constrained areas .

Researchers have found a way to use regular mobile phones to track and monitor mosquito populations around the world. By recording the unique sounds of mosquito wings, even basic mobile phones can collect data on which species of mosquitoes are present and where they are located. This new technique is quick, simple, and cost-effective, making it accessible for non-experts to use in the field. Using the data gathered, public health officials can create more targeted plans for controlling diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. With this method, we can better understand and combat mosquito-borne diseases around the world.


76 T cell immunodominance is dictated by the positively selecting self-peptide

Naive T cell precursor frequency determines the magnitude of immunodominance .
While a broad T cell repertoire requires diverse positively selecting self-peptides , how a single positively selecting ligand influences naive T cell precursor frequency remains undefined .
We generated a transgenic mouse expressing a naturally occurring self-peptide , gp250 , that positively selects an MCC-specific TCR , AND , as the only MHC class II I-Ek ligand to study the MCC highly organized immunodominance hierarchy .
The single gp250/I-Ek ligand greatly enhanced MCC-tetramer+ CD4+ T cells , and skewed MCC-tetramer+ population toward V11α+Vβ3+ , a major TCR pair in MCC-specific immunodominance .
The gp250-selected V11α+Vβ3+ CD4+ T cells had a significantly increased frequency of conserved MCC-preferred CDR3 features .
Our studies establish a direct and causal relationship between a selecting self-peptide and the specificity of the selected TCRs .
Thus , an immunodominant T cell response can be due to a dominant positively selecting self-peptide .

Have you ever wondered why some diseases are more easily fought off by the body than others? Scientists have discovered that the number of certain immune cells called T cells that can fight a disease depends on the presence of specific self-peptides. These self-peptides act as "selectors", determining which T cells are able to fight the disease. Through studies on transgenic mice, researchers found that the presence of a particular self-peptide caused a significant increase in T cells that can fight a specific disease. This discovery helps explain why certain diseases are more easily fought off than others, and could ultimately lead to new treatments.


77 Revealing the neural fingerprints of a missing hand

The hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex contains detailed finger topography , thought to be shaped and maintained by daily life experience .
Here we utilise phantom sensations and ultra high-field neuroimaging to uncover preserved , though latent , representation of amputees’ missing hand .
We show that representation of the missing hand’s individual fingers persists in the primary somatosensory cortex even decades after arm amputation .
By demonstrating stable topography despite amputation , our finding questions the extent to which continued sensory input is necessary to maintain organisation in sensory cortex , thereby reopening the question what happens to a cortical territory once its main input is lost .
The discovery of persistent digit topography of amputees’ missing hand could be exploited for the development of intuitive and fine-grained control of neuroprosthetics , requiring neural signals of individual digits .

The part of our brain that senses touch in our hands has a detailed map of our fingers, which gets shaped by our daily experiences. Researchers have used unique techniques to study what happens to this map when someone loses an arm. By studying people who feel a "phantom" version of their missing hand, they found that the brain's finger map still exists, even many years after the amputation. This challenges our understanding of how the brain works, and could be used to create better prosthetic limbs that can precisely control individual fingers.


78 The splicing regulators Esrp1 and Esrp2 direct an epithelial splicing program essential for mammalian development

Tissue- and cell-type-specific regulators of alternative splicing ( AS ) are essential components of posttranscriptional gene regulation , necessary for normal cellular function , patterning , and development .
Mice with ablation of Epithelial splicing regulatory protein ( Esrp1 ) develop cleft lip and palate .
Loss of both Esrp1 and its paralog Esrp2 results in widespread developmental defects with broad implications to human disease .
Deletion of the Esrps in the epidermis revealed their requirement for establishing a proper skin barrier , a primary function of epithelial cells comprising the epidermis .
We profiled the global Esrp-mediated splicing regulatory program in epidermis , which revealed large-scale programs of epithelial cell-type-specific splicing required for epithelial cell functions .
These mice represent a valuable model for evaluating the essential role for AS in development and function of epithelial cells , which play essential roles in tissue homeostasis in numerous organs , and provide a genetic tool to evaluate important functional properties of epithelial-specific splice variants in vivo .

Alternative splicing is a process that helps control how our genetic instructions are used to build different types of cells and tissues. Researchers have discovered that a group of proteins called Epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (Esrps) are particularly important for this process in cells that make up our skin and other organs. When these Esrp proteins are missing, mice develop problems with their skin and facial structure, which could have implications for certain human diseases. By studying these mice, scientists can learn more about how alternative splicing affects the health and function of important cells in our bodies.


79 Lipocalin-2 is an anorexigenic signal in primates

In the mouse , the osteoblast-derived hormone Lipocalin-2 ( LCN2 ) suppresses food intake and acts as a satiety signal .
We show here that meal challenges increase serum LCN2 levels in persons with normal or overweight , but not in individuals with obesity .
Postprandial LCN2 serum levels correlate inversely with hunger sensation in challenged subjects .
We further show through brain PET scans of monkeys injected with radiolabeled recombinant human LCN2 ( rh-LCN2 ) and autoradiography in baboon , macaque , and human brain sections , that LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier and localizes to the hypothalamus in primates .
In addition , daily treatment of lean monkeys with rh-LCN2 decreases food intake by 21% , without overt side effects .
These studies demonstrate the biology of LCN2 as a satiety factor and indicator and anorexigenic signal in primates .
Failure to stimulate postprandial LCN2 in individuals with obesity may contribute to metabolic dysregulation , suggesting that LCN2 may be a novel target for obesity treatment .

Scientists have discovered a hormone called Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) in mice that can make them feel full and suppress their appetite. In people with a healthy weight or who are slightly overweight, LCN2 levels increase after a meal, and the higher the levels of LCN2, the less hungry people feel. The hormone can pass through the blood-brain barrier and go to the hypothalamus in the brain, where it can reduce food intake. In monkeys, LCN2 treatment decreases food intake without any negative side effects. However, in people with obesity, LCN2 levels don't increase after a meal, which may contribute to metabolic problems. Scientists think that targeting LCN2 may be a new way to treat obesity.


80 Neural coding in barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion

Animals seek out relevant information by moving through a dynamic world , but sensory systems are usually studied under highly constrained and passive conditions that may not probe important dimensions of the neural code .
Here , we explored neural coding in the barrel cortex of head-fixed mice that tracked walls with their whiskers in tactile virtual reality .
Optogenetic manipulations revealed that barrel cortex plays a role in wall-tracking .
Closed-loop optogenetic control of layer 4 neurons can substitute for whisker-object contact to guide behavior resembling wall tracking .
We measured neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging and extracellular recordings .
Neurons were tuned to the distance between the animal snout and the contralateral wall , with monotonic , unimodal , and multimodal tuning curves .
This rich representation of object location in the barrel cortex could not be predicted based on simple stimulus-response relationships involving individual whiskers and likely emerges within cortical circuits .

In this study, we looked at how mice use their whiskers to navigate through virtual reality environments. We found that a specific part of their brain, called the barrel cortex, is important for tracking walls. By using a special technique called optogenetics, we were able to control the activity of certain brain cells and mimic the behavior of whiskers touching a wall. We measured the activity of these cells and found that they were tuned to the distance between the mouse's nose and the wall it was tracking. This suggests that the brain has a very rich way of representing object location that goes beyond just responding to individual whisker movements.


81 Epigenetic modification of the PD-1 (Pdcd1) promoter in effector CD4+ T cells tolerized by peptide immunotherapy

Clinically effective antigen-based immunotherapy must silence antigen-experienced effector T cells ( Teff ) driving ongoing immune pathology .
Using CD4+ autoimmune Teff cells , we demonstrate that peptide immunotherapy ( PIT ) is strictly dependent upon sustained T cell expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1 .
We found high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ) at the PD-1 ( Pdcd1 ) promoter of non-tolerant T cells .
5hmC was lost in response to PIT , with DNA hypomethylation of the promoter .
We identified dynamic changes in expression of the genes encoding the Ten-Eleven-Translocation ( TET ) proteins that are associated with the oxidative conversion 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC , during cytosine demethylation .
We describe a model whereby promoter demethylation requires the co-incident expression of permissive histone modifications at the Pdcd1 promoter together with TET availability .
This combination was only seen in tolerant Teff cells following PIT , but not in Teff that transiently express PD-1 .
Epigenetic changes at the Pdcd1 locus therefore determine the tolerizing potential of TCR-ligation .

This study explores a new immunotherapy approach to treat autoimmune diseases by targeting a specific type of T cell called effector T cells. The researchers found that this therapy relies on a molecule called PD-1 to be effective. They also discovered a process called demethylation that occurs in tolerant T cells, which helps reduce inflammation and promote healing. These findings could help lead to more effective treatments for autoimmune diseases.


82 Wild cereal grain consumption among Early Holocene foragers of the Balkans predates the arrival of agriculture

Forager focus on wild cereal plants has been documented in the core zone of domestication in southwestern Asia , while evidence for forager use of wild grass grains remains sporadic elsewhere .
In this paper , we present starch grain and phytolith analyses of dental calculus from 60 Mesolithic and Early Neolithic individuals from five sites in the Danube Gorges of the central Balkans .
This zone was inhabited by likely complex Holocene foragers for several millennia before the appearance of the first farmers ~6200 cal BC .
We also analyzed forager ground stone tools ( GSTs ) for evidence of plant processing .
Our results based on the study of dental calculus show that certain species of Poaceae ( species of the genus Aegilops ) were used since the Early Mesolithic , while GSTs exhibit traces of a developed grass grain processing technology .
The adoption of domesticated plants in this region after ~6500 cal BC might have been eased by the existing familiarity with wild cereals .

This study looked at the diets of ancient hunters and gatherers in the Balkans before farming was introduced. By studying dental remains and stone tools, the researchers found evidence of these people using wild grains from certain grasses, including species of Aegilops, for thousands of years. This suggests that these foragers had a developed technique for processing grass grains. It's possible that this knowledge made it easier for these communities to adopt domesticated plants once farming was introduced to the region.


83 Premature polyadenylation of MAGI3 produces a dominantly-acting oncogene in human breast cancer

Genetic mutation , chromosomal rearrangement and copy number amplification are common mechanisms responsible for generating gain-of-function , cancer-causing alterations .
Here we report a new mechanism by which premature cleavage and polyadenylation ( pPA ) of RNA can produce an oncogenic protein .
We identify a pPA event at a cryptic intronic poly ( A ) signal in MAGI3 , occurring in the absence of local exonic and intronic mutations .
The altered mRNA isoform , called MAGI3pPA , produces a truncated protein that acts in a dominant-negative manner to prevent full-length MAGI3 from interacting with the YAP oncoprotein , thereby relieving YAP inhibition and promoting malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells .
We additionally find evidence for recurrent expression of MAGI3pPA in primary human breast tumors but not in tumor-adjacent normal tissues .
Our results provide an example of how pPA contributes to cancer by generating a truncated mRNA isoform that encodes an oncogenic , gain-of-function protein .

Cancer cells often have genetic changes that make them different from normal cells. These changes can include mutations, rearrangements, and extra copies of certain genes. Scientists have discovered a new way that cells can develop these changes, called premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of RNA. This process creates a shortened version of a protein that can cause cancer. Researchers found that this process happens in a gene called MAGI3, which is commonly found in breast cancer cells. They observed that this shortened protein prevents the normal version of MAGI3 from working properly and promotes the growth of cancer cells. This finding could help develop new treatments for breast cancer that target MAGI3pPA.


84 A dedicated visual pathway for prey detection in larval zebrafish

Zebrafish larvae show characteristic prey capture behavior in response to small moving objects .
The neural mechanism used to recognize objects as prey remains largely unknown .
We devised a machine learning behavior classification system to quantify hunting kinematics in semi-restrained animals exposed to a range of virtual stimuli .
Two-photon calcium imaging revealed a small visual area , AF7 , that was activated specifically by the optimal prey stimulus .
This pretectal region is innervated by two types of retinal ganglion cells , which also send collaterals to the optic tectum .
Laser ablation of AF7 markedly reduced prey capture behavior .
We identified neurons with arbors in AF7 and found that they projected to multiple sensory and premotor areas: the optic tectum , the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus ( nMLF ) and the hindbrain .
These findings indicate that computations in the retina give rise to a visual stream which transforms sensory information into a directed prey capture response .

Researchers found that zebrafish larvae exhibit a unique hunting behavior when faced with small moving objects, but we don’t know how their brains recognize these objects as prey. In a new study, scientists developed a system using machine learning to measure this behavior and then used calcium imaging to identify a small area in the brain, which is activated specifically when these fish are exposed to prey-like stimuli. By selectively removing this area, they found that prey capture behavior was drastically reduced. Furthermore, they identified specific neurons in this area that are connected to other parts of the brain responsible for processing visual and movement information. Overall, these findings suggest that the fish use a combination of their eyes and brain to quickly identify prey and respond accordingly.


85 Biomarkers in a socially exchanged fluid reflect colony maturity, behavior, and distributed metabolism

In cooperative systems exhibiting division of labor , such as microbial communities , multicellular organisms , and social insect colonies , individual units share costs and benefits through both task specialization and exchanged materials .
Socially exchanged fluids , like seminal fluid and milk , allow individuals to molecularly influence conspecifics .
Many social insects have a social circulatory system , where food and endogenously produced molecules are transferred mouth-to-mouth ( stomodeal trophallaxis ) , connecting all the individuals in the society .
To understand how these endogenous molecules relate to colony life , we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the trophallactic fluid within colonies of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus .
We show that different stages of the colony life cycle circulate different types of proteins: young colonies prioritize direct carbohydrate processing; mature colonies prioritize accumulation and transmission of stored resources .
Further , colonies circulate proteins implicated in oxidative stress , ageing , and social insect caste determination , potentially acting as superorganismal hormones .
Brood-caring individuals that are also closer to the queen in the social network ( nurses ) showed higher abundance of oxidative stress-related proteins .
Thus , trophallaxis behavior could provide a mechanism for distributed metabolism in social insect societies .
The ability to thoroughly analyze the materials exchanged between cooperative units makes social insect colonies useful models to understand the evolution and consequences of metabolic division of labor at other scales .

Scientists are studying how social insects, like ants, share fluids and molecules to understand how they work together as a society. These insects have a special system where they exchange fluids and molecules through their mouths, connecting all members of the colony. By looking at the proteins in these fluids, scientists found that young colonies prioritize food processing while older ones prioritize storing and sharing resources. They also found that certain proteins are linked to stress, aging, and determining social status in these insects. Nurses in the colony showed higher levels of stress-related proteins. This research helps us understand how these insects work together as a group and how other animals might do the same.


86 Modelling dynamics in protein crystal structures by ensemble refinement

Single-structure models derived from X-ray data do not adequately account for the inherent , functionally important dynamics of protein molecules .
We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged refinement , where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics ( MD ) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation–libration–screw ( TLS ) model .
Modeling of 20 protein datasets at 1 . 1–3 . 1 Å resolution reduced cross-validated Rfree values by 0 . 3–4 . 9% , indicating that ensemble models fit the X-ray data better than single structures .
The ensembles revealed that , while most proteins display a well-ordered core , some proteins exhibit a ‘molten core’ likely supporting functionally important dynamics in ligand binding , enzyme activity and protomer assembly .
Order–disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues .
Thus , ensemble refinement extracts dynamical details from the X-ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding of structure–dynamics–function relationships .

Scientists have found that traditional models of protein molecules, created using X-ray data, do not fully capture their functionally important movements. To address this, they used a technique called time-averaged refinement to create multiple models that capture the molecular vibrations of individual proteins. By studying 20 different protein datasets, they found that these ensemble models provide a better fit to the data than traditional, single-structure models. Additionally, they found that some proteins have a "molten core" that supports important movements related to binding to other molecules or enzymatic activity. By understanding these movements more fully, we can gain a better understanding of protein function and contribute to the development of new treatments for related diseases.


87 Cdon mutation and fetal alcohol converge on Nodal signaling in a mouse model of holoprosencephaly

Holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) , a defect in midline patterning of the forebrain and midface , arises ~1 in 250 conceptions .
It is associated with predisposing mutations in the Nodal and Hedgehog ( HH ) pathways , with penetrance and expressivity graded by genetic and environmental modifiers , via poorly understood mechanisms .
CDON is a multifunctional co-receptor , including for the HH pathway .
In mice , Cdon mutation synergizes with fetal alcohol exposure , producing HPE phenotypes closely resembling those seen in humans .
We report here that , unexpectedly , Nodal signaling is a major point of synergistic interaction between Cdon mutation and fetal alcohol .
Window-of-sensitivity , genetic , and in vitro findings are consistent with a model whereby brief exposure of Cdon mutant embryos to ethanol during gastrulation transiently and partially inhibits Nodal pathway activity , with consequent effects on midline patterning .
These results illuminate mechanisms of gene-environment interaction in a multifactorial model of a common birth defect .

Holoprosencephaly is a birth defect where the forebrain and midface do not form correctly, affecting about 1 in 250 pregnancies. It is caused by changes in certain genes and environmental factors, but we don't fully understand how. Scientists studied a protein called CDON that helps with the formation of the brain, and found that when it isn't working properly and the developing baby is exposed to alcohol, the chances of developing holoprosencephaly increase. They think this is because alcohol affects another important pathway called Nodal. These findings help us understand how genes and the environment can work together to cause birth defects.


88 Neural basis for regulation of vasopressin secretion by anticipated disturbances in osmolality

Water balance , tracked by extracellular osmolality , is regulated by feedback and feedforward mechanisms .
Feedback regulation is reactive , occurring as deviations in osmolality are detected .
Feedforward or presystemic regulation is proactive , occurring when disturbances in osmolality are anticipated .
Vasopressin ( AVP ) is a key hormone regulating water balance and is released during hyperosmolality to limit renal water excretion .
AVP neurons are under feedback and feedforward regulation .
Not only do they respond to disturbances in blood osmolality , but they are also rapidly suppressed and stimulated , respectively , by drinking and eating , which will ultimately decrease and increase osmolality .
Here , we demonstrate that AVP neuron activity is regulated by multiple anatomically and functionally distinct neural circuits .
Notably , presystemic regulation during drinking and eating are mediated by non-overlapping circuits that involve the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus , respectively .
These findings reveal neural mechanisms that support differential regulation of AVP release by diverse behavioral and physiological stimuli .

This article discusses the way in which our body regulates water balance. There are two types of regulation: reactive and proactive. Reactive regulation happens when our body detects a change in the amount of water in our body and responds accordingly. Proactive regulation occurs when our body anticipates a change in the amount of water in our body and prepares for it. The hormone vasopressin is key to regulating water balance and is released when our body has too much water to limit the amount of water that is excreted through urination. Vasopressin is regulated by many different parts of our brain and body, including areas that control drinking and eating. The research discussed in this article shows us the different systems in our brain that work together to help us maintain the right amount of water in our body.


89 A multidisciplinary approach to a unique palaeolithic human ichnological record from Italy (Bàsura Cave)

Based on the integration of laser scans , sedimentology , geochemistry , archeobotany , geometric morphometrics and photogrammetry , here we present evidence testifying that a Palaeolithic group of people explored a deep cave in northern Italy about 14 ky cal .
BP .
Ichnological data enable us to shed light on individual and group level behavior , social relationship , and mode of exploration of the uneven terrain .
Five individuals , two adults , an adolescent and two children , entered the cave barefoot and illuminated the way with a bunch of wooden sticks .
Traces of crawling locomotion are documented for the first time in the global human ichnological record .
Anatomical details recognizable in the crawling traces show that no clothing was present between limbs and the trampled sediments .
Our study demonstrates that very young children ( the youngest about 3 years old ) were active members of the Upper Palaeolithic populations , even in apparently dangerous and social activities .

A group of people who lived a long time ago explored a deep cave in northern Italy. We know this because scientists used lasers, rocks, plants, and pictures to study the cave. They found out that five people, including children as young as 3 years old, went into the cave without shoes and used sticks for light. They also crawled on their hands and knees in some places. This helps us understand how these ancient people behaved and how they explored the world around them.


90 Switch-like and persistent memory formation in individual Drosophila larvae

Associative learning allows animals to use past experience to predict future events .
The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function , often in response to a single example .
Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular , synaptic , cellular , and circuit levels , often simultaneously , but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals , and it has been difficult to form long-lasting memories , especially those requiring synaptic reorganization .
We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae .
We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
We confirm that when coupled to CO2 presentation in appropriate temporal sequence , optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2 .
We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states .
Memories can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO2 but are stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation .
Finally , we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation .

Have you ever felt like you knew what was going to happen next based on past experiences? Animals use this kind of "associative learning" all the time! Scientists have been studying how our brains form these memories and have discovered that even one experience can make a difference. To understand this better, they studied the memory formation of baby fruit flies. They developed a new test that could track the learning and memory of each individual fruit fly. They found that when they stimulated parts of the flies' brains that give rewards while exposing them to something they usually avoid (like carbon dioxide gas), the flies began to change their behavior. After enough training, the flies started to remember that they shouldn't avoid carbon dioxide gas, and their memories even lasted a long time! This research shows that certain memories rely on new proteins being made in the brain, while others don't. It's all very fascinating and could help us better understand how our own brains work too!


91 Place recognition using batlike sonar

Echolocating bats have excellent spatial memory and are able to navigate to salient locations using bio-sonar .
Navigating and route-following require animals to recognize places .
Currently , it is mostly unknown how bats recognize places using echolocation .
In this paper , we propose template based place recognition might underlie sonar-based navigation in bats .
Under this hypothesis , bats recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout .
Using a large body of ensonification data collected in three different habitats , we test the viability of this hypothesis assessing two critical properties of the proposed echo signatures: ( 1 ) they can be uniquely classified and ( 2 ) they vary continuously across space .
Based on the results presented , we conclude that the proposed echo signatures satisfy both criteria .
We discuss how these two properties of the echo signatures can support navigation and building a cognitive map .

Bats are amazing animals that use bio-sonar to navigate to important locations. They have great memory of these places, but we don't know exactly how they remember them. In this study, we suggest that bats might recognize places by their echoes, instead of their physical appearance. This means they remember the unique sound of a place, rather than what it looks like. To test this idea, we collected a lot of data in three different places and found that the echoes were unique and changed in a predictable way across the space. This could help bats navigate and create a mental map of their environment.


92 Two-way communication between SecY and SecA suggests a Brownian ratchet mechanism for protein translocation

The essential process of protein secretion is achieved by the ubiquitous Sec machinery .
In prokaryotes , the drive for translocation comes from ATP hydrolysis by the cytosolic motor-protein SecA , in concert with the proton motive force ( PMF ) .
However , the mechanism through which ATP hydrolysis by SecA is coupled to directional movement through SecYEG is unclear .
Here , we combine all-atom molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations with single molecule FRET and biochemical assays .
We show that ATP binding by SecA causes opening of the SecY-channel at long range , while substrates at the SecY-channel entrance feed back to regulate nucleotide exchange by SecA .
This two-way communication suggests a new , unifying 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism , whereby ATP binding and hydrolysis bias the direction of polypeptide diffusion .
The model represents a solution to the problem of transporting inherently variable substrates such as polypeptides , and may underlie mechanisms of other motors that translocate proteins and nucleic acids .

Proteins are important for many things in our bodies and they are made up of long chains of building blocks called amino acids. When proteins need to be transported to different parts of the body, a machine called the Sec machinery helps with the process. In simple living cells, a tiny motor protein called SecA uses energy from ATP to help move the protein through the Sec machinery. Scientists have been trying to figure out exactly how this works, and they've used computer simulations and experiments to study it. What they found is that when SecA binds to ATP, it opens up the pathway that the protein travels through. The protein then helps to regulate how much ATP SecA uses. This discovery helps us understand how proteins are able to move around in our bodies and could explain how other motor proteins work as well.


93 Timing mechanism of sexually dimorphic nervous system differentiation

The molecular mechanisms that control the timing of sexual differentiation in the brain are poorly understood .
We found that the timing of sexually dimorphic differentiation of postmitotic , sex-shared neurons in the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans male is controlled by the temporally regulated miRNA let-7 and its target lin-41 , a translational regulator .
lin-41 acts through lin-29a , an isoform of a conserved Zn finger transcription factor , expressed in a subset of sex-shared neurons only in the male .
Ectopic lin-29a is sufficient to impose male-specific features at earlier stages of development and in the opposite sex .
The temporal , sexual and spatial specificity of lin-29a expression is controlled intersectionally through the lin-28/let-7/lin-41 heterochronic pathway , sex chromosome configuration and neuron-type-specific terminal selector transcription factors .
Two Doublesex-like transcription factors represent additional sex- and neuron-type specific targets of LIN-41 and are regulated in a similar intersectional manner .

We don't know much about how the brain decides whether to develop as male or female. But in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that a specific molecule called let-7 controls this process. By targeting a molecule called lin-41, let-7 activates a gene called lin-29a, which tells certain neurons to develop in a male-specific way. We also found that other genes and factors play a role in this process, including sex chromosomes and other neuron-specific molecules. Altogether, this helps us understand how sex is determined in the brain.


94 A widely employed germ cell marker is an ancient disordered protein with reproductive functions in diverse eukaryotes

The advent of sexual reproduction and the evolution of a dedicated germline in multicellular organisms are critical landmarks in eukaryotic evolution .
We report an ancient family of GCNA ( germ cell nuclear antigen ) proteins that arose in the earliest eukaryotes , and feature a rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered region ( IDR ) .
Phylogenetic analysis reveals that GCNA proteins emerged before the major eukaryotic lineages diverged; GCNA predates the origin of a dedicated germline by a billion years .
Gcna gene expression is enriched in reproductive cells across eukarya – either just prior to or during meiosis in single-celled eukaryotes , and in stem cells and germ cells of diverse multicellular animals .
Studies of Gcna-mutant C . elegans and mice indicate that GCNA has functioned in reproduction for at least 600 million years .
Homology to IDR-containing proteins implicated in DNA damage repair suggests that GCNA proteins may protect the genomic integrity of cells carrying a heritable genome .

Scientists have discovered an ancient family of proteins, called GCNA, that are involved in reproduction and help protect cells from DNA damage. These proteins emerged in the earliest forms of complex life on Earth and existed before the development of specialized reproductive cells. They are found in reproductive cells across many different species, including single-celled organisms and multicellular animals. Research on animals like worms and mice has shown that GCNA has played a role in reproduction for at least 600 million years. These findings help us understand the evolution of sexual reproduction and the importance of maintaining the integrity of our genetic material.


95 Oviductal estrogen receptor α signaling prevents protease-mediated embryo death

Development of uterine endometrial receptivity for implantation is orchestrated by cyclic steroid hormone-mediated signals .
It is unknown if these signals are necessary for oviduct function in supporting fertilization and preimplantation development .
Here we show that conditional knockout ( cKO ) mice lacking estrogen receptor α ( ERα ) in oviduct and uterine epithelial cells have impaired fertilization due to a dramatic reduction in sperm migration .
In addition , all successfully fertilized eggs die before the 2-cell stage due to persistence of secreted innate immune mediators including proteases .
Elevated protease activity in cKO oviducts causes premature degradation of the zona pellucida and embryo lysis , and wild-type embryos transferred into cKO oviducts fail to develop normally unless rescued by concomitant transfer of protease inhibitors .
Thus , suppression of oviductal protease activity mediated by estrogen-epithelial ERα signaling is required for fertilization and preimplantation embryo development .
These findings have implications for human infertility and post-coital contraception .

When a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, it needs a special receptive environment to develop and grow. This environment is created by signals sent out by the hormones in our bodies. Scientists are now exploring whether these signals are also important for the fertilization process itself. In a recent study, researchers discovered that mice lacking a specific hormone receptor had trouble with fertilization - sperm struggled to move and the embryos that did form didn't survive past an early stage. The reason for this seems to be that the mice were producing too many enzymes that were breaking down the developing embryo too soon. These findings could have implications for human infertility and developing new forms of contraception.


96 The transcription factor FOXL2 mobilizes estrogen signaling to maintain the identity of ovarian granulosa cells

FOXL2 is a lineage determining transcription factor in the ovary , but its direct targets and modes of action are not fully characterized .
In this study , we explore the targets of FOXL2 and five nuclear receptors in murine primary follicular cells .
We found that FOXL2 is required for normal gene regulation by steroid receptors , and we show that estrogen receptor beta ( ESR2 ) is the main vector of estradiol signaling in these cells .
Moreover , we found that FOXL2 directly modulates Esr2 expression through a newly identified intronic element .
Interestingly , we found that FOXL2 repressed the testis-determining gene Sox9 both independently of estrogen signaling and through the activation of ESR2 expression .
Altogether , we show that FOXL2 mobilizes estrogen signaling to establish a coherent feed-forward loop repressing Sox9 .
This sheds a new light on the role of FOXL2 in ovarian maintenance and function .

In this study, we investigated how a protein called FOXL2 affects the genes involved in the development and functioning of ovaries. We found that FOXL2 works together with other proteins to control the way cells respond to hormones like estrogen. Specifically, FOXL2 helps to turn on a gene called ESR2 which is important for estrogen signaling in these cells. We also discovered that FOXL2 helps to prevent the expression of a gene called Sox9, which is normally involved in the development of male reproductive organs. Our results suggest that FOXL2 plays a critical role in maintaining and controlling the function of ovaries.


97 Integrated action of pheromone signals in promoting courtship behavior in male mice

The mammalian vomeronasal organ encodes pheromone information about gender , reproductive status , genetic background and individual differences .
It remains unknown how pheromone information interacts to trigger innate behaviors .
In this study , we identify vomeronasal receptors responsible for detecting female pheromones .
A sub-group of V1re clade members recognizes gender-identifying cues in female urine .
Multiple members of the V1rj clade are cognate receptors for urinary estrus signals , as well as for sulfated estrogen ( SE ) compounds .
In both cases , the same cue activates multiple homologous receptors , suggesting redundancy in encoding female pheromone cues .
Neither gender-specific cues nor SEs alone are sufficient to promote courtship behavior in male mice , whereas robust courtship behavior can be induced when the two cues are applied together .
Thus , integrated action of different female cues is required in pheromone-triggered mating behavior .
These results suggest a gating mechanism in the vomeronasal circuit in promoting specific innate behavior .

We studied how animals respond to different pheromones, which are chemicals that carry information about gender, reproductive status, genetic background, and individual differences. Specifically, we looked at the vomeronasal organ in mammals, which detects these pheromones and triggers innate behaviors. We found that there are certain receptors in the vomeronasal organ that detect female pheromones. These receptors respond to different cues in female urine, such as gender-identifying signals and certain compounds. However, the same cue can activate multiple receptors, which means there is some redundancy in encoding these signals. We also found that male mice only respond to a combination of these different cues, not just one by itself. These results suggest that there is a gating mechanism in the vomeronasal circuit that promotes specific innate behavior, like mating.


98 Two distinct DNA sequences recognized by transcription factors represent enthalpy and entropy optima

Most transcription factors ( TFs ) can bind to a population of sequences closely related to a single optimal site .
However , some TFs can bind to two distinct sequences that represent two local optima in the Gibbs free energy of binding ( ΔG ) .
To determine the molecular mechanism behind this effect , we solved the structures of human HOXB13 and CDX2 bound to their two optimal DNA sequences , CAATAAA and TCGTAAA .
Thermodynamic analyses by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that both sites were bound with similar ΔG .
However , the interaction with the CAA sequence was driven by change in enthalpy ( ΔH ) , whereas the TCG site was bound with similar affinity due to smaller loss of entropy ( ΔS ) .
This thermodynamic mechanism that leads to at least two local optima likely affects many macromolecular interactions , as ΔG depends on two partially independent variables ΔH and ΔS according to the central equation of thermodynamics , ΔG = ΔH - TΔS .

Scientists have discovered that some proteins called transcription factors can bind to two DNA sequences instead of just one. To figure out why this happens, they studied two proteins called HOXB13 and CDX2 and found that they bind to two different DNA sequences with similar strength but in different ways. One sequence is bound because it causes a change in heat energy, while the other is bound because it causes a smaller change in chaos. This discovery could help explain how many different molecules interact with each other, and it all comes down to basic principles of science.


99 Bacterial flagellar capping proteins adopt diverse oligomeric states

Flagella are crucial for bacterial motility and pathogenesis .
The flagellar capping protein ( FliD ) regulates filament assembly by chaperoning and sorting flagellin ( FliC ) proteins after they traverse the hollow filament and exit the growing flagellum tip .
In the absence of FliD , flagella are not formed , resulting in impaired motility and infectivity .
Here , we report the 2 . 2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of FliD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the first high-resolution structure of any FliD protein from any bacterium .
Using this evidence in combination with a multitude of biophysical and functional analyses , we find that Pseudomonas FliD exhibits unexpected structural similarity to other flagellar proteins at the domain level , adopts a unique hexameric oligomeric state , and depends on flexible determinants for oligomerization .
Considering that the flagellin filaments on which FliD oligomers are affixed vary in protofilament number between bacteria , our results suggest that FliD oligomer stoichiometries vary across bacteria to complement their filament assemblies .

Bacteria use tiny tails called flagella to move around and infect their hosts. A protein called FliD plays a critical role in helping to assemble these flagella by sorting and organizing the building blocks of the tail. Without FliD, bacteria are unable to make functional flagella, which can greatly reduce their ability to move and infect. Researchers recently discovered the structure of FliD from a type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that the protein is shaped similarly to other flagellar proteins, but has a unique structure and depends on flexibility to form groups of six proteins. This flexibility likely helps the protein adapt to the variations in flagella among different bacteria.


100 A mutant Escherichia coli that attaches peptidoglycan to lipopolysaccharide and displays cell wall on its surface

The lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) forms the surface-exposed leaflet of the outer membrane ( OM ) of Gram-negative bacteria , an organelle that shields the underlying peptidoglycan ( PG ) cell wall .
Both LPS and PG are essential cell envelope components that are synthesized independently and assembled by dedicated transenvelope multiprotein complexes .
We have identified a point-mutation in the gene for O-antigen ligase ( WaaL ) in Escherichia coli that causes LPS to be modified with PG subunits , intersecting these two pathways .
Synthesis of the PG-modified LPS ( LPS* ) requires ready access to the small PG precursor pool but does not weaken cell wall integrity , challenging models of precursor sequestration at PG assembly machinery .
LPS* is efficiently transported to the cell surface without impairing OM function .
Because LPS* contains the canonical vancomycin binding site , these surface-exposed molecules confer increased vancomycin-resistance by functioning as molecular decoys that titrate the antibiotic away from its intracellular target .
This unexpected LPS glycosylation fuses two potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) .

Scientists have discovered a new way that bacteria can resist antibiotics. Bacteria have an outer layer called the outer membrane that helps protect them. This layer is made up of two parts: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG). The scientists found that a small change in a gene in Escherichia coli bacteria caused the LPS to be modified with PG, which has never been seen before. This modified LPS still allows the bacteria to function normally, but it also contains a site where vancomycin (a common antibiotic) can bind. This means that the bacteria can avoid being killed by vancomycin by having these modified LPS molecules on their surface. This discovery is important because it shows how bacteria are evolving to become more resistant to antibiotics, which makes it harder for us to treat infections.


101 G protein βγ subunits inhibit TRPM3 ion channels in sensory neurons

Transient receptor potential ( TRP ) ion channels in peripheral sensory neurons are functionally regulated by hydrolysis of the phosphoinositide PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and changes in the level of protein kinase mediated phosphorylation following activation of various G protein coupled receptors .
We now show that the activity of TRPM3 expressed in mouse dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons is inhibited by agonists of the Gi-coupled µ opioid , GABA-B and NPY receptors .
These agonist effects are mediated by direct inhibition of TRPM3 by Gβγ subunits , rather than by a canonical cAMP mediated mechanism .
The activity of TRPM3 in DRG neurons is also negatively modulated by tonic , constitutive GPCR activity as TRPM3 responses can be potentiated by GPCR inverse agonists .
GPCR regulation of TRPM3 is also seen in vivo where Gi/o GPCRs agonists inhibited and inverse agonists potentiated TRPM3 mediated nociceptive behavioural responses .

A certain type of cell in our bodies called peripheral sensory neurons use ion channels called TRP to sense different sensations. These TRP channels are influenced by a substance called PI (4,5) P2 and by different receptors that are activated by certain proteins in the body. Scientists have discovered that certain pain relievers and neurotransmitters like GABA and NPY can directly inhibit TRP channels through special proteins called Gβγ subunits. This way, they can lessen the sensation of pain without using traditional pain relief methods. Additionally, it has been found that some proteins that are always active in our neurons can also either enhance or reduce the activity of TRP channels. This is important because it helps to better understand how pain signals are processed in our bodies and may lead to new ways to relieve pain without side-effects.


102 Preexisting memory CD4 T cells in naïve individuals confer robust immunity upon hepatitis B vaccination

Antigen recognition through the T cell receptor ( TCR ) αβ heterodimer is one of the primary determinants of the adaptive immune response .
Vaccines activate naïve T cells with high specificity to expand and differentiate into memory T cells .
However , antigen-specific memory CD4 T cells exist in unexposed antigen-naïve hosts .
In this study , we use high-throughput sequencing of memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire and machine learning to show that individuals with preexisting vaccine-reactive memory CD4 T cell clonotypes elicited earlier and higher antibody titers and mounted a more robust CD4 T cell response to hepatitis B vaccine .
In addition , integration of TCRβ sequence patterns into a hepatitis B epitope-specific annotation model can predict which individuals will have an early and more vigorous vaccine-elicited immunity .
Thus , the presence of preexisting memory T cell clonotypes has a significant impact on immunity and can be used to predict immune responses to vaccination .

Our immune system uses T cells to recognize and fight off foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. Vaccines help teach our immune system to recognize these invaders before we get infected. This study found that some people already have a type of memory T cell that recognizes certain vaccine targets, even if they have never been exposed to them before. These individuals had a stronger and faster immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine than those without these preexisting memory cells. By analyzing the DNA of these cells, we can predict which individuals will have a better response to the vaccine. This discovery could help improve vaccine efficacy and make them more personalized.


103 A mutation uncouples the tubulin conformational and GTPase cycles, revealing allosteric control of microtubule dynamics

Microtubule dynamic instability depends on the GTPase activity of the polymerizing αβ-tubulin subunits , which cycle through at least three distinct conformations as they move into and out of microtubules .
How this conformational cycle contributes to microtubule growing , shrinking , and switching remains unknown .
Here , we report that a buried mutation in αβ-tubulin yields microtubules with dramatically reduced shrinking rate and catastrophe frequency .
The mutation causes these effects by suppressing a conformational change that normally occurs in response to GTP hydrolysis in the lattice , without detectably changing the conformation of unpolymerized αβ-tubulin .
Thus , the mutation weakens the coupling between the conformational and GTPase cycles of αβ-tubulin .
By showing that the mutation predominantly affects post-GTPase conformational and dynamic properties of microtubules , our data reveal that the strength of the allosteric response to GDP in the lattice dictates the frequency of catastrophe and the severity of rapid shrinking .

Microtubules are important structures in cells that help maintain their shape and support their functions. They are made up of αβ-tubulin subunits that constantly change shape as they grow and shrink. Scientists have been trying to figure out how these shape changes affect the behavior of microtubules. In this study, researchers found that a certain mutation in the αβ-tubulin subunits slows down the process of microtubules shrinking. This mutation affects how the subunits change shape in response to a chemical called GTP, which is important for the growth and stability of microtubules. By understanding the role of this mutation, scientists can learn more about how microtubules work and potentially develop new treatments for diseases that involve problems with these structures.


104 Extensive translation of small Open Reading Frames revealed by Poly-Ribo-Seq

Thousands of small Open Reading Frames ( smORFs ) with the potential to encode small peptides of fewer than 100 amino acids exist in our genomes .
However , the number of smORFs actually translated , and their molecular and functional roles are still unclear .
In this study , we present a genome-wide assessment of smORF translation by ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions in Drosophila .
We detect two types of smORFs bound by multiple ribosomes and thus undergoing productive translation .
The ‘longer’ smORFs of around 80 amino acids resemble canonical proteins in translational metrics and conservation , and display a propensity to contain transmembrane motifs .
The ‘dwarf’ smORFs are in general shorter ( around 20 amino-acid long ) , are mostly found in 5′-UTRs and non-coding RNAs , are less well conserved , and have no bioinformatic indicators of peptide function .
Our findings indicate that thousands of smORFs are translated in metazoan genomes , reinforcing the idea that smORFs are an abundant and fundamental genome component .

Scientists have discovered that there are thousands of small Open Reading Frames (smORFs) in our genomes that have the ability to create tiny proteins of less than 100 amino acids. However, researchers are still unsure how many of these actually translate into proteins and what their functions may be. In a new study, scientists have performed a genome-wide investigation of smORF translation in fruit flies. They have found that there are two types of smORFs that are being productively translated by multiple ribosomes. Longer ones are similar to traditional proteins and tend to have transmembrane regions, while shorter ones mainly exist in non-coding regions and have no known function. These findings suggest that smORFs are an essential component of our genomes and may play vital roles in metazoan organisms.


105 Rate and timing of cortical responses driven by separate sensory channels

The sense of touch comprises multiple sensory channels that each conveys characteristic signals during interactions with objects .
These neural signals must then be integrated in such a way that behaviorally relevant information about the objects is preserved .
To understand the process of integration , we implement a simple computational model that describes how the responses of neurons in somatosensory cortex—recorded from awake , behaving monkeys—are shaped by the peripheral input , reconstructed using simulations of neuronal populations that reproduce natural spiking responses in the nerve with millisecond precision .
First , we find that the strength of cortical responses is driven by one population of nerve fibers ( rapidly adapting ) whereas the timing of cortical responses is shaped by the other ( Pacinian ) .
Second , we show that input from these sensory channels is integrated in an optimal fashion that exploits the disparate response behaviors of different fiber types .

Our ability to sense objects through touch relies on multiple channels that each give unique signals to our brains. It's important that these signals are integrated in a way that preserves important information about the objects. To understand this process, scientists studied neurons in the somatosensory cortex of awake monkeys. They found that the strength and timing of the neurons' responses were influenced by different types of nerve fibers. Additionally, they discovered that the brain integrates information from these different channels in an effective way that takes advantage of the unique responses of each type of nerve fiber.


106 Cell type specificity of neurovascular coupling in cerebral cortex

Identification of the cellular players and molecular messengers that communicate neuronal activity to the vasculature driving cerebral hemodynamics is important for ( 1 ) the basic understanding of cerebrovascular regulation and ( 2 ) interpretation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) signals .
Using a combination of optogenetic stimulation and 2-photon imaging in mice , we demonstrate that selective activation of cortical excitation and inhibition elicits distinct vascular responses and identify the vasoconstrictive mechanism as Neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) acting on Y1 receptors .
The latter implies that task-related negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI signals in the cerebral cortex under normal physiological conditions may be mainly driven by the NPY-positive inhibitory neurons .
Further , the NPY-Y1 pathway may offer a potential therapeutic target in cerebrovascular disease .

Scientists have discovered important information about how the brain communicates with blood vessels in our heads. This will help us understand how our brains control blood flow and how we can interpret brain scans. By using special techniques to stimulate different parts of the brain in mice, the researchers were able to identify a molecule called Neuropeptide Y (NPY) as a key player in regulating blood flow. This discovery could lead to new treatments for diseases that affect blood flow to the brain.


107 Elucidation of a four-site allosteric network in fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases

Receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) signaling is tightly regulated by protein allostery within the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains .
Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood .
By means of structural ( X-ray and NMR ) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor ( FGFR ) tyrosine kinase domain , we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the ‘molecular brake’ , ‘DFG latch’ , ‘A-loop plug’ , and ‘αC tether’ .
The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation , whereas the αC tether promotes the active conformation .
The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site .
Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs , we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs .

Scientists have discovered how a protein called RTK is controlled within cells. They found that certain areas, called the "molecular brake", "DFG latch", "A-loop plug", and "αC tether", work together to regulate the protein's activity. This four-site network keeps the protein from becoming too active, but also allows it to turn on when needed. The scientists believe this model could apply to other similar proteins in the body. This research may in the future help scientists understand the causes of certain diseases that involve this protein.


108 SynEM, automated synapse detection for connectomics

Nerve tissue contains a high density of chemical synapses , about 1 per µm3 in the mammalian cerebral cortex .
Thus , even for small blocks of nerve tissue , dense connectomic mapping requires the identification of millions to billions of synapses .
While the focus of connectomic data analysis has been on neurite reconstruction , synapse detection becomes limiting when datasets grow in size and dense mapping is required .
Here , we report SynEM , a method for automated detection of synapses from conventionally en-bloc stained 3D electron microscopy image stacks .
The approach is based on a segmentation of the image data and focuses on classifying borders between neuronal processes as synaptic or non-synaptic .
SynEM yields 97% precision and recall in binary cortical connectomes with no user interaction .
It scales to large volumes of cortical neuropil , plausibly even whole-brain datasets .
SynEM removes the burden of manual synapse annotation for large densely mapped connectomes .

Our nerves are made up of tiny structures called synapses which allow them to communicate with each other. To understand how our brain functions, scientists need to map out these synapses in great detail, which can be a daunting task due to their high density. Traditionally, this mapping process involved a lot of manual work. However, a new method called SynEM has been developed that automates this process using electron microscopy images. With no need for user interaction, SynEM can identify synapses with 97% accuracy in large datasets, even those covering entire brains. This technology removes the need for tedious manual detection and enables more efficient mapping of nerve connections.


109 Identification of octopaminergic neurons that modulate sleep suppression by male sex drive

Molecular and circuit mechanisms for balancing competing drives are not well understood .
While circadian and homeostatic mechanisms generally ensure sufficient sleep at night , other pressing needs can overcome sleep drive .
Here , we demonstrate that the balance between sleep and sex drives determines whether male flies sleep or court , and identify a subset of octopaminergic neurons ( MS1 ) that regulate sleep specifically in males .
When MS1 neurons are activated , isolated males sleep less , and when MS1 neurons are silenced , the normal male sleep suppression in female presence is attenuated and mating behavior is impaired .
MS1 neurons do not express the sexually dimorphic FRUITLESS ( FRU ) transcription factor , but form male-specific contacts with FRU-expressing neurons; calcium imaging experiments reveal bidirectional functional connectivity between MS1 and FRU neurons .
We propose octopaminergic MS1 neurons interact with the FRU network to mediate sleep suppression by male sex drive .

Scientists do not know much about how our bodies balance different needs when it comes to sleep. While our internal clocks and processes usually ensure we get enough rest at night, sometimes other things can make us feel more awake. In this study, researchers found that in male flies, the balance between their desire for sleep and their desire to mate determines what they do. They also discovered a set of special cells in the male flies’ brains called MS1 neurons that regulate sleep in male flies specifically. When they activated these neurons, the flies slept less, and when they silenced them, the flies had trouble mating and sleeping properly. The MS1 neurons work with other cells in a specific network, and the scientists think they might be involved in how male flies’ sex drive affects their sleep.


110 The ectodomains determine ligand function in vivo and selectivity of DLL1 and DLL4 toward NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in vitro

DLL1 and DLL4 are Notch ligands with high structural similarity but context-dependent functional differences .
Here , we analyze their functional divergence using cellular co-culture assays , biochemical studies , and in vivo experiments .
DLL1 and DLL4 activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 differently in cell-based assays and this discriminating potential lies in the region between the N-terminus and EGF repeat three .
Mice expressing chimeric ligands indicate that the ectodomains dictate ligand function during somitogenesis , and that during myogenesis even regions C-terminal to EGF3 are interchangeable .
Substitution of NOTCH1-interface residues in the MNNL and DSL domains of DLL1 with the corresponding amino acids of DLL4 , however , does not disrupt DLL1 function in vivo .
Collectively , our data show that DLL4 preferentially activates NOTCH1 over NOTCH2 , whereas DLL1 is equally effective in activating NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 , establishing that the ectodomains dictate selective ligand function in vivo , and that features outside the known binding interface contribute to their differences .

Scientists have been studying two similar molecules called DLL1 and DLL4. These molecules can activate specific proteins called NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. The scientists wanted to understand why these molecules can have different effects even though they look so similar. They did experiments using cells and live mice, and found that the part of the molecules near the beginning was very important for determining which protein was activated. They also found that during different stages of development, the molecules could have different effects. Overall, they learned that even small differences in the molecules can make a big difference in how they work in the body.


111 PIP2 depletion promotes TRPV4 channel activity in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells

We recently reported that the inward-rectifier Kir2 . 1 channel in brain capillary endothelial cells ( cECs ) plays a major role in neurovascular coupling ( NVC ) by mediating a neuronal activity-dependent , propagating vasodilatory ( hyperpolarizing ) signal .
We further demonstrated that Kir2 . 1 activity is suppressed by depletion of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) .
Whether cECs express depolarizing channels that intersect with Kir2 . 1-mediated signaling remains unknown .
Here , we report that Ca2+/Na+-permeable TRPV4 ( transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 ) channels are expressed in cECs and are tonically inhibited by PIP2 .
We further demonstrate that depletion of PIP2 by agonists , including putative NVC mediators , that promote PIP2 hydrolysis by signaling through Gq-protein-coupled receptors ( GqPCRs ) caused simultaneous disinhibition of TRPV4 channels and suppression of Kir2 . 1 channels .
These findings collectively support the concept that GqPCR activation functions as a molecular switch to favor capillary TRPV4 activity over Kir2 . 1 signaling , an observation with potentially profound significance for the control of cerebral blood flow .

We recently discovered that a specific channel in brain cells called Kir2.1 plays an important role in how our brain regulates blood flow. We found that when neurons in our brain become active, Kir2.1 sends a signal that causes our blood vessels to widen, allowing more blood to flow to that area. 

However, we also found that this channel is suppressed when a certain molecule called PIP2 is depleted from the cell membrane. We wanted to investigate whether there are other channels in the brain cells that may work against Kir2.1 in regulating blood flow.

We discovered a new channel called TRPV4 that is found in these cells. This channel is normally turned off by PIP2, but when it is activated by certain molecules, it can cause Kir2.1 to become less active while increasing blood flow. These findings could have important implications for how we understand and regulate blood flow in the brain.


112 A social chemosignaling function for human handshaking

Social chemosignaling is a part of human behavior , but how chemosignals transfer from one individual to another is unknown .
In turn , humans greet each other with handshakes , but the functional antecedents of this behavior remain unclear .
To ask whether handshakes are used to sample conspecific social chemosignals , we covertly filmed 271 subjects within a structured greeting event either with or without a handshake .
We found that humans often sniff their own hands , and selectively increase this behavior after handshake .
After handshakes within gender , subjects increased sniffing of their own right shaking hand by more than 100% .
In contrast , after handshakes across gender , subjects increased sniffing of their own left non-shaking hand by more than 100% .
Tainting participants with unnoticed odors significantly altered the effects , thus verifying their olfactory nature .
Thus , handshaking may functionally serve active yet subliminal social chemosignaling , which likely plays a large role in ongoing human behavior .

When we meet someone, we sometimes shake hands. But scientists don't know why we do this or how it affects our behavior. To investigate, researchers filmed people greeting each other either with or without a handshake. They found that people sniff their own hands more often after shaking hands, especially if they are of the same gender. This suggests that handshakes are a way for people to "smell" each other without realizing it. The researchers also found that adding a scent that people couldn't detect changed their behavior, which confirms that our sense of smell plays a big role in how we interact with each other.


113 Robust model-based analysis of single-particle tracking experiments with Spot-On

Single-particle tracking ( SPT ) has become an important method to bridge biochemistry and cell biology since it allows direct observation of protein binding and diffusion dynamics in live cells .
However , accurately inferring information from SPT studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design .
To address analysis bias , we introduce ‘Spot-On’ , an intuitive web-interface .
Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases , including molecules moving out-of-focus , and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories .
To minimize inherent experimental biases , we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation SPT ( spaSPT ) , which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors .
We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods .
We then apply Spot-On to spaSPT data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants .

Scientists use a method called Single-particle tracking (SPT) to study proteins and how they move in live cells. This allows them to better understand how cells work. However, analyzing the data from SPT studies is difficult because of mistakes in both the way the data is collected and analyzed. To fix this problem, researchers have created a new tool called 'Spot-On' that helps correct these mistakes. They also developed a new way to collect the data using a method called stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT), which reduces errors. They tested their tool using virtual experiments and found it worked better than other tools. Finally, they used the tool to look at real data from mammalian cells and found that it consistently gave good results.


114 Decoys provide a scalable platform for the identification of plant E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate circadian function

The circadian clock relies on regulated degradation of clock proteins to maintain rhythmicity .
Despite this , we know few components that mediate protein degradation .
This is due to high levels of functional redundancy within plant E3 ubiquitin ligase families .
In order to overcome this issue and discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that control circadian function , we generated a library of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing dominant-negative ‘decoy’ E3 ubiquitin ligases .
We determined their effects on the circadian clock and identified dozens of new potential regulators of circadian function .
To demonstrate the potency of the decoy screening methodology to overcome redundancy and identify bona fide clock regulators , we performed follow-up studies on MAC3A ( PUB59 ) and MAC3B ( PUB60 ) .
We show that they redundantly control circadian period by regulating splicing .
This work demonstrates the viability of ubiquitin ligase decoys as a screening platform to overcome genetic challenges and discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate plant development .

Our bodies have an internal "clock" that helps us sleep and wake up at consistent times. This clock relies on certain proteins that need to be degraded in a regulated manner for it to work properly. However, we still don't know a lot about the proteins that are involved in this process because there are too many similar options to choose from in plants. In order to identify the proteins that are most important for our internal clock, scientists created a bunch of plants that had certain "decoy" proteins in them. By studying how these plants' internal clocks changed, the scientists were able to identify dozens of new potential regulators that could help us sleep and wake up on time. They also found two proteins called MAC3A and MAC3B that work together to control our internal clock by regulating how our genes are "spliced" together. This study shows that using these decoy proteins in plants is a great way to figure out which proteins help regulate our internal clocks.


115 Multiplexed imaging of immune cells in staged multiple sclerosis lesions by mass cytometry

Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is characterized by demyelinated and inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord that are highly variable in terms of cellular content .
Here , we used imaging mass cytometry ( IMC ) to enable the simultaneous imaging of 15+ proteins within staged MS lesions .
To test the potential for IMC to discriminate between different types of lesions , we selected a case with severe rebound MS disease activity after natalizumab cessation .
With post-acquisition analysis pipelines we were able to: ( 1 ) Discriminate demyelinating macrophages from the resident microglial pool; ( 2 ) Determine which types of lymphocytes reside closest to blood vessels; ( 3 ) Identify multiple subsets of T and B cells , and ( 4 ) Ascertain dynamics of T cell phenotypes vis-à-vis lesion type and location .
We propose that IMC will enable a comprehensive analysis of single-cell phenotypes , their functional states and cell-cell interactions in relation to lesion morphometry and demyelinating activity in MS patients .

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, causing damage to the protective covering of nerve cells. We used a new technology called imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to study MS lesions in detail. By looking at 15+ proteins at the same time, we were able to see differences between different types of lesions. We analyzed the cells within the lesions and found different types of immune cells, including ones that attack the nerve cells. We believe that by using IMC, we can better understand how cells interact and contribute to MS progression.


116 Inhibition of ErbB kinase signalling promotes resolution of neutrophilic inflammation

Neutrophilic inflammation with prolonged neutrophil survival is common to many inflammatory conditions , including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
There are few specific therapies that reverse neutrophilic inflammation , but uncovering mechanisms regulating neutrophil survival is likely to identify novel therapeutic targets .
Screening of 367 kinase inhibitors in human neutrophils and a zebrafish tail fin injury model identified ErbBs as common targets of compounds that accelerated inflammation resolution .
The ErbB inhibitors gefitinib , CP-724714 , erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 significantly accelerated apoptosis of human neutrophils , including neutrophils from people with COPD .
Neutrophil apoptosis was also increased in Tyrphostin AG825 treated-zebrafish in vivo .
Tyrphostin AG825 decreased peritoneal inflammation in zymosan-treated mice , and increased lung neutrophil apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis in a murine acute lung injury model .
Tyrphostin AG825 and knockdown of egfra and erbb2 by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced inflammation in zebrafish .
Our work shows that inhibitors of ErbB kinases have therapeutic potential in neutrophilic inflammatory disease .

Inflammation is a common problem in many diseases, including COPD. It's hard to find treatments that specifically target the inflammation, but new research has identified some potential options. Scientists tested 367 different drugs on human cells and zebrafish, and found that some drugs that target ErbB proteins can help reduce inflammation. When they tested these drugs on mice and zebrafish, they saw improvements in inflammation. This research suggests that drugs that target ErbB proteins could be helpful in treating inflammatory diseases.


117 The molecular architecture of engulfment during Bacillus subtilis sporulation

The study of bacterial cell biology is limited by difficulties in visualizing cellular structures at high spatial resolution within their native milieu .
Here , we visualize Bacillus subtilis sporulation using cryo-electron tomography coupled with cryo-focused ion beam milling , allowing the reconstruction of native-state cellular sections at molecular resolution .
During sporulation , an asymmetrically-positioned septum generates a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore .
Subsequently , the mother cell engulfs the forespore .
We show that the septal peptidoglycan is not completely degraded at the onset of engulfment .
Instead , the septum is uniformly and only slightly thinned as it curves towards the mother cell .
Then , the mother cell membrane migrates around the forespore in tiny finger-like projections , whose formation requires the mother cell SpoIIDMP protein complex .
We propose that a limited number of SpoIIDMP complexes tether to and degrade the peptidoglycan ahead of the engulfing membrane , generating an irregular membrane front .

Scientists have trouble seeing inside bacterial cells to understand their behavior. In this study, researchers used a special technique to look at how a type of bacteria called Bacillus subtilis grows and reproduces. They found that during this process, the cell divides unequally to form a bigger "mother" cell and a smaller "forespore". The mother cell then wraps around and engulfs the forespore. The scientists discovered that the cell wall that separates the two parts of the cell is not completely destroyed during this process. Instead, it gets thinner as the mother cell wraps around the forespore. They also found that special proteins called SpoIIDMP are necessary for the wrapping to happen correctly. These proteins help break down the cell wall so the mother cell can surround the forespore.


118 Reverse translation of adverse event reports paves the way for de-risking preclinical off-targets

The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System ( FAERS ) remains the primary source for post-marketing pharmacovigilance .
The system is largely un-curated , unstandardized , and lacks a method for linking drugs to the chemical structures of their active ingredients , increasing noise and artefactual trends .
To address these problems , we mapped drugs to their ingredients and used natural language processing to classify and correlate drug events .
Our analysis exposed key idiosyncrasies in FAERS , for example reports of thalidomide causing a deadly ADR when used against myeloma , a likely result of the disease itself; multiplications of the same report , unjustifiably increasing its importance; correlation of reported ADRs with public events , regulatory announcements , and with publications .
Comparing the pharmacological , pharmacokinetic , and clinical ADR profiles of methylphenidate , aripiprazole , and risperidone , and of kinase drugs targeting the VEGF receptor , demonstrates how underlying molecular mechanisms can emerge from ADR co-analysis .
The precautions and methods we describe may enable investigators to avoid confounding chemistry-based associations and reporting biases in FAERS , and illustrate how comparative analysis of ADRs can reveal underlying mechanisms .

The Food and Drug Administration has a system called FAERS that helps monitor the safety of drugs after they hit the market. However, this system can have some problems, like having incomplete or inconsistent information. To fix this, researchers used technology to match drugs to their active ingredients and to group similar reports together. They found some interesting things, like how reports of one drug causing problems might actually be linked to the disease it treats instead. By studying how different drugs compare in terms of side effects, scientists can get a better idea of how they work and what to watch out for. This research can help improve drug safety monitoring and make sure people get the best care possible.


119 Egr2 induction in spiny projection neurons of the ventrolateral striatum contributes to cocaine place preference in mice

Drug addiction develops due to brain-wide plasticity within neuronal ensembles , mediated by dynamic gene expression .
Though the most common approach to identify such ensembles relies on immediate early gene expression , little is known of how the activity of these genes is linked to modified behavior observed following repeated drug exposure .
To address this gap , we present a broad-to-specific approach , beginning with a comprehensive investigation of brain-wide cocaine-driven gene expression , through the description of dynamic spatial patterns of gene induction in subregions of the striatum , and finally address functionality of region-specific gene induction in the development of cocaine preference .
Our findings reveal differential cell-type specific dynamic transcriptional recruitment patterns within two subdomains of the dorsal striatum following repeated cocaine exposure .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that induction of the IEG Egr2 in the ventrolateral striatum , as well as the cells within which it is expressed , are required for the development of cocaine seeking .

Drug addiction happens when our brains change in response to repeated exposure to addictive substances. These changes involve groups of cells in the brain that work together to create cravings and addiction. Scientists have been studying the genes that are active in these groups of cells, hoping to find ways to better understand and treat addiction. In this study, researchers investigated the activity of specific genes in the brain of mice that had been repeatedly exposed to cocaine. They found that certain genes were especially important for creating the desire to seek out and use cocaine. Understanding these patterns of gene activity could help scientists develop new treatments to help people overcome addiction.


120 Computational models of O-LM cells are recruited by low or high theta frequency inputs depending on h-channel distributions

Although biophysical details of inhibitory neurons are becoming known , it is challenging to map these details onto function .
Oriens-lacunosum/moleculare ( O-LM ) cells are inhibitory cells in the hippocampus that gate information flow , firing while phase-locked to theta rhythms .
We build on our existing computational model database of O-LM cells to link model with function .
We place our models in high-conductance states and modulate inhibitory inputs at a wide range of frequencies .
We find preferred spiking recruitment of models at high ( 4–9 Hz ) or low ( 2–5 Hz ) theta depending on , respectively , the presence or absence of h-channels on their dendrites .
This also depends on slow delayed-rectifier potassium channels , and preferred theta ranges shift when h-channels are potentiated by cyclic AMP .
Our results suggest that O-LM cells can be differentially recruited by frequency-modulated inputs depending on specific channel types and distributions .
This work exposes a strategy for understanding how biophysical characteristics contribute to function .

Scientists are studying a type of brain cell that helps control how information is passed through the brain. These cells are called Oriens-lacunosum/moleculare cells (O-LM cells) and they fire in a particular rhythm. The scientists used computer models to study how these cells work and found that the rhythm they fire at depends on the specific channels and structures in the cells. This research helps us understand how these brain cells contribute to brain function.


121 Structural basis of transcription inhibition by the DNA mimic protein Ocr of bacteriophage T7

Bacteriophage T7 infects Escherichia coli and evades the host restriction/modification system .
The Ocr protein of T7 was shown to exist as a dimer mimicking DNA and to bind to host restriction enzymes , thus preventing the degradation of the viral genome by the host .
Here we report that Ocr can also inhibit host transcription by directly binding to bacterial RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) and competing with the recruitment of RNAP by sigma factors .
Using cryo electron microscopy , we determined the structures of Ocr bound to RNAP .
The structures show that an Ocr dimer binds to RNAP in the cleft , where key regions of sigma bind and where DNA resides during transcription synthesis , thus providing a structural basis for the transcription inhibition .
Our results reveal the versatility of Ocr in interfering with host systems and suggest possible strategies that could be exploited in adopting DNA mimicry as a basis for forming novel antibiotics .

This study looks at how a virus called bacteriophage T7 avoids being destroyed by a bacteria it infects called Escherichia coli. The virus uses a protein called Ocr, which acts like DNA, to keep the bacteria from breaking down the virus's genetic material. But the researchers also found that Ocr can stop the bacteria from making proteins by competing with a molecule called RNAP, which is important for making proteins. They used special imaging techniques to see the Ocr protein binding to RNAP. These findings show how adaptable the virus can be and suggest that scientists could use this knowledge to develop new antibiotics.


122 A sleep state in Drosophila larvae required for neural stem cell proliferation

Sleep during development is involved in refining brain circuitry , but a role for sleep in the earliest periods of nervous system elaboration , when neurons are first being born , has not been explored .
Here we identify a sleep state in Drosophila larvae that coincides with a major wave of neurogenesis .
Mechanisms controlling larval sleep are partially distinct from adult sleep: octopamine , the Drosophila analog of mammalian norepinephrine , is the major arousal neuromodulator in larvae , but dopamine is not required .
Using real-time behavioral monitoring in a closed-loop sleep deprivation system , we find that sleep loss in larvae impairs cell division of neural progenitors .
This work establishes a system uniquely suited for studying sleep during nascent periods , and demonstrates that sleep in early life regulates neural stem cell proliferation .

When we sleep, our brains do a lot of important work, especially when we're babies and our brains are still developing. So far, scientists haven't looked much at how sleep affects the very early stages of brain development, when new brain cells are first forming.

But in this study, researchers looked at how sleep affects baby fruit flies. They found that when these flies are in the early stages of making new brain cells, they also have a special kind of sleep that's different from adult sleep. They also discovered that a chemical in the fly brains called octopamine is important for making these baby flies wake up. And when they watched the baby flies in a special sleep-deprivation system, they found that being sleep-deprived made it harder for the baby flies to make new brain cells. 

This is really important because it means that studying baby flies can help us learn more about how sleep affects the very early stages of brain development. And it shows us that getting enough sleep when we're babies is really important for making sure we grow up with healthy brains.


123 A common bacterial metabolite elicits prion-based bypass of glucose repression

Robust preference for fermentative glucose metabolism has motivated domestication of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element , the [GAR+] prion , permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources .
Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [GAR+] , although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown .
Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [GAR+] inducer .
Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression .
This trait had the defining genetic properties of [GAR+] , and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source .
Lactic acid also induced [GAR+]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from S . cerevisiae ~200 million years ago , and in which glucose repression evolved independently .
To our knowledge , this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion .

Scientists have discovered a way to help yeast cells break down different types of sugars at the same time, instead of just focusing on glucose, which is their preferred sugar. This is thanks to a protein called [GAR+] prion, which can be induced in yeast by certain bacteria. The researchers found that a specific bacterial byproduct called lactic acid is a strong inducer of [GAR+], meaning that it can help yeast cells process sugars other than glucose. Even more interestingly, exposure to lactic acid caused the yeast cells to pass on this ability to their offspring, showing that it was a genetic characteristic. The researchers also found that lactic acid could induce a similar genetic change in fungi that evolved separately from the yeast, meaning that this discovery could have implications for other organisms too. Overall, this is the first time that a bacterial byproduct has been shown to have such a powerful effect on the genetics of another organism.


124 Transcription mediated insulation and interference direct gene cluster expression switches

In yeast , many tandemly arranged genes show peak expression in different phases of the metabolic cycle ( YMC ) or in different carbon sources , indicative of regulation by a bi-modal switch , but it is not clear how these switches are controlled .
Using native elongating transcript analysis ( NET-seq ) , we show that transcription itself is a component of bi-modal switches , facilitating reciprocal expression in gene clusters .
HMS2 , encoding a growth-regulated transcription factor , switches between sense- or antisense-dominant states that also coordinate up- and down-regulation of transcription at neighbouring genes .
Engineering HMS2 reveals alternative mono- , di- or tri-cistronic and antisense transcription units ( TUs ) , using different promoter and terminator combinations , that underlie state-switching .
Promoters or terminators are excluded from functional TUs by read-through transcriptional interference , while antisense TUs insulate downstream genes from interference .
We propose that the balance of transcriptional insulation and interference at gene clusters facilitates gene expression switches during intracellular and extracellular environmental change .

Scientists have been studying how genes in yeast are regulated during different phases of the metabolic cycle or when different carbon sources are present. They found that the process of transcription itself plays a key role in this regulation, allowing genes to switch on and off in groups. One particular gene, HMS2, plays an important role in this process by switching between different "states" that affect neighboring genes. By manipulating HMS2, the scientists were able to create different transcription units that control gene expression. They also found that certain types of transcription units can protect genes from interference by other genes. This research helps us understand how yeast cells adapt to changes in their environment by turning specific sets of genes on and off.


125 Behavioral-state modulation of inhibition is context-dependent and cell type specific in mouse visual cortex

Cortical responses to sensory stimuli are modulated by behavioral state .
In the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) , visual responses of pyramidal neurons increase during locomotion .
This response gain was suggested to be mediated through inhibitory neurons , resulting in the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons .
Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1 , we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) , somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PV ) -positive interneurons during visual stimulation , challenging the disinhibition model .
In darkness , while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive , SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive .
Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type , with the highest proportion among SST neurons .
These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state .

Our brain's responses to what we see, hear, and feel are influenced by how we are feeling and what we are doing. Researchers have found that when we are moving, our brain's response to visual stimuli (what we see) gets stronger. Scientists used special techniques to look at brain activity in mice and found that different types of brain cells are responsible for this effect. These cells, called interneurons, become more active during movement and help to control the brain's response to what we see. Interestingly, some types of interneurons only become more active during movement when there is light, while others do it all the time. This tells us that the brain's response to what we see is not just controlled by one type of cell, but by many different ones working together.


126 Fast and accurate edge orientation processing during object manipulation

Quickly and accurately extracting information about a touched object’s orientation is a critical aspect of dexterous object manipulation .
However , the speed and acuity of tactile edge orientation processing with respect to the fingertips as reported in previous perceptual studies appear inadequate in these respects .
Here we directly establish the tactile system’s capacity to process edge-orientation information during dexterous manipulation .
Participants extracted tactile information about edge orientation very quickly , using it within 200 ms of first touching the object .
Participants were also strikingly accurate .
With edges spanning the entire fingertip , edge-orientation resolution was better than 3° in our object manipulation task , which is several times better than reported in previous perceptual studies .
Performance remained impressive even with edges as short as 2 mm , consistent with our ability to precisely manipulate very small objects .
Taken together , our results radically redefine the spatial processing capacity of the tactile system .

Our sense of touch plays a crucial role in being able to manipulate objects with ease. However, previous studies have shown that our ability to quickly and accurately determine an object's orientation through touch is limited. In this study, we set out to test the limits of our tactile system's ability to process this kind of information. We found that participants were able to extract information about an object's orientation within just 200 milliseconds of touching it and were very accurate in doing so. Even with very small edges, our ability to determine orientation was surprisingly precise. These findings challenge what we previously thought about the spatial processing abilities of our sense of touch.


127 Thermal fluctuations of immature SOD1 lead to separate folding and misfolding pathways

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease involving cytotoxic conformations of Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) .
A major challenge in understanding ALS disease pathology has been the identification and atomic-level characterization of these conformers .
Here , we use a combination of NMR methods to detect four distinct sparsely populated and transiently formed thermally accessible conformers in equilibrium with the native state of immature SOD1 ( apoSOD12SH ) .
Structural models of two of these establish that they possess features present in the mature dimeric protein .
In contrast , the other two are non-native oligomers in which the native dimer interface and the electrostatic loop mediate the formation of aberrant intermolecular interactions .
Our results show that apoSOD12SH has a rugged free energy landscape that codes for distinct kinetic pathways leading to either maturation or non-native association and provide a starting point for a detailed atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms of SOD1 oligomerization .

ALS is a disease that damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. Scientists are trying to understand how the disease develops so they can find new treatments. One key factor is a protein called SOD1, which can take on different shapes or "conformations" that may be harmful. In this study, researchers used a technique called NMR to identify four different conformations of SOD1 in a less mature form of the protein. They found that two of these shapes were similar to the normal, healthy form of SOD1, while the other two were abnormal and potentially harmful. By understanding how SOD1 takes on different shapes, scientists can work towards developing therapies for ALS.


128 Molecular structure of human KATP in complex with ATP and ADP

In many excitable cells , KATP channels respond to intracellular adenosine nucleotides: ATP inhibits while ADP activates .
We present two structures of the human pancreatic KATP channel , containing the ABC transporter SUR1 and the inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir6 . 2 , in the presence of Mg2+ and nucleotides .
These structures , referred to as quatrefoil and propeller forms , were determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3 . 9 Å and 5 . 6 Å , respectively .
In both forms , ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6 . 2 .
The nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg2+-ATP in the degenerate site and Mg2+-ADP in the consensus site .
A lasso extension forms an interface between SUR1 and Kir6 . 2 adjacent to the ATP site in the propeller form and is disrupted in the quatrefoil form .
These structures support the role of SUR1 as an ADP sensor and highlight the lasso extension as a key regulatory element in ADP’s ability to override ATP inhibition .

The KATP channel helps control the activity of some cells in our body. We studied this channel in the pancreas and found two different shapes it can take. We used a special technique to see them up close. In both shapes, a molecule called ATP makes the channel less active. But another molecule called ADP makes it more active. We also found that a part of the channel called SUR1 senses ADP and helps it override the effects of ATP. This information could help us better understand how our bodies regulate certain processes.


129 Dissection of the in vitro developmental program of Hammondia hammondi reveals a link between stress sensitivity and life cycle flexibility in Toxoplasma gondii

Most eukaryotic parasites are obligately heteroxenous , requiring sequential infection of different host species in order to survive .
Toxoplasma gondii is a rare exception to this rule , having a uniquely facultative heteroxenous life cycle .
To understand the origins of this phenomenon , we compared development and stress responses in T . gondii to those of its its obligately heteroxenous relative , Hammondia hammondi and have identified multiple H . hammondi growth states that are distinct from those in T . gondii .
Of these , the most dramatic difference was that H . hammondi was refractory to stressors that robustly induce cyst formation in T . gondii , and this was reflected most dramatically in its unchanging transcriptome after stress exposure .
We also found that H . hammondi could be propagated in vitro for up to 8 days post-excystation , and we exploited this to generate the first ever transgenic H . hammondi line .
Overall our data show that H . hammondi zoites grow as stringently regulated , unique life stages that are distinct from T . gondii tachyzoites , and implicate stress sensitivity as a potential developmental innovation that increased the flexibility of the T . gondii life cycle .

Most parasites need to infect different types of animals to survive, but Toxoplasma gondii is different - it can live in one type of animal or many. Scientists wanted to find out why, so they compared T. gondii to another parasite called Hammondia hammondi. They saw that H. hammondi grows differently than T. gondii and is not very affected by stress, while T. gondii forms protective cysts when stressed. The researchers even made a new kind of H. hammondi in the lab! All of this helps us understand how parasites can live in different animals.


130 Methylation of histone H3K23 blocks DNA damage in pericentric heterochromatin during meiosis

Despite the well-established role of heterochromatin in protecting chromosomal integrity during meiosis and mitosis , the contribution and extent of heterochromatic histone posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) remain poorly defined .
Here , we gained novel functional insight about heterochromatic PTMs by analyzing histone H3 purified from the heterochromatic germline micronucleus of the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila .
Mass spectrometric sequencing of micronuclear H3 identified H3K23 trimethylation ( H3K23me3 ) , a previously uncharacterized PTM .
H3K23me3 became particularly enriched during meiotic leptotene and zygotene in germline chromatin of Tetrahymena and C . elegans .
Loss of H3K23me3 in Tetrahymena through deletion of the methyltransferase Ezl3p caused mislocalization of meiosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) to heterochromatin , and a decrease in progeny viability .
These results show that an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway regulates H3K23me3 during meiosis , and our studies in Tetrahymena suggest this pathway may function to protect heterochromatin from DSBs .

This study looked at how our DNA stays safe during cell division. We know that certain parts of our DNA, called heterochromatin, help protect our chromosomes, but we don't know much about the different types of changes they undergo. The researchers studied a tiny, but useful, organism called Tetrahymena thermophila to find out more. They discovered a new kind of change to a protein called histone H3, called H3K23 trimethylation. They also found that this change happens a lot when our cells divide to make eggs and sperm. When they removed this change from the DNA in Tetrahymena, the cells didn't protect themselves as well and had more problems during cell division. This new understanding of how our DNA stays safe might help in preventing genetic diseases.


131 Using aquatic animals as partners to increase yield and maintain soil nitrogen in the paddy ecosystems

Whether species coculture can overcome the shortcomings of crop monoculture requires additional study .
Here , we show how aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , and softshell turtles ) benefit paddy ecosystems when cocultured with rice .
Three separate field experiments and three separate mesocosm experiments were conducted .
Each experiment included a rice monoculture ( RM ) treatment and a rice-aquatic animal ( RA ) coculture treatment; RA included feed addition for aquatic animals .
In the field experiments , rice yield was higher with RA than with RM , and RA also produced aquatic animal yields that averaged 0 . 52–2 . 57 t ha-1 .
Compared to their corresponding RMs , the three RAs had significantly higher apparent nitrogen ( N ) -use efficiency and lower weed infestation , while soil N contents were stable over time .
Dietary reconstruction analysis based on 13C and 15N showed that 16 . 0–50 . 2% of aquatic animal foods were from naturally occurring organisms in the rice fields .
Stable-isotope-labeling ( 13C ) in the field experiments indicated that the organic matter decomposition rate was greater with RA than with RM .
Isotope 15N labeling in the mesocosm experiments indicated that rice used 13 . 0–35 . 1% of the aquatic animal feed-N .
All these results suggest that rice-aquatic animal coculture increases food production , increases N-use efficiency , and maintains soil N content by reducing weeds and promoting decomposition and complementary N use .
Our study supports the view that adding species to monocultures may enhance agroecosystem functions .

This study looked at whether adding aquatic animals like carp, crabs, and softshell turtles to rice paddies could make the crops healthier and more productive. They did three experiments in the field and three in tanks. In each experiment they compared rice plants grown alone to rice plants grown with the animals. They found that the rice grew better and there were more aquatic animals in the areas where they were growing together. The animals actually helped the rice to grow better and stay healthy. This is a good way to make sure crops are healthy and productive without damaging the soil or using too many chemicals.


132 The ceramide synthase 2b gene mediates genomic sensing and regulation of sphingosine levels during zebrafish embryogenesis

Sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) is generated through phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases ( Sphk1 and Sphk2 ) .
We show that sphk2 maternal-zygotic mutant zebrafish embryos ( sphk2MZ ) display early developmental phenotypes , including a delay in epiboly , depleted S1P levels , elevated levels of sphingosine , and resistance to sphingosine toxicity .
The sphk2MZ embryos also have strikingly increased levels of maternal transcripts encoding ceramide synthase 2b ( Cers2b ) , and loss of Cers2b in sphk2MZ embryos phenocopies sphingosine toxicity .
An upstream region of the cers2b promoter supports enhanced expression of a reporter gene in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype embryos .
Furthermore , ectopic expression of Cers2b protein itself reduces activity of the promoter , and this repression is relieved by exogenous sphingosine .
Therefore , the sphk2MZ genome recognizes the lack of sphingosine kinase activity and up-regulates cers2b as a salvage pathway for sphingosine turnover .
Cers2b can also function as a sphingolipid-responsive factor to mediate at least part of a feedback regulatory mechanism .

This study looked at how a molecule called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is generated in fish embryos during development. The researchers found that fish embryos with a certain mutation had delayed development and depleted levels of S1P, but higher levels of another molecule called sphingosine. These embryos also had increased levels of a gene called Cers2b, which helps with sphingosine turnover. When this gene was removed, the embryos showed signs of sphingosine toxicity. The researchers also found that the Cers2b gene can respond to changes in sphingolipids and help regulate their levels in the embryo. These findings show how the embryo tries to fix problems with sphingolipid levels and maintain healthy development.


133 Likelihood approximation networks (LANs) for fast inference of simulation models in cognitive neuroscience

In cognitive neuroscience , computational modeling can formally adjudicate between theories and affords quantitative fits to behavioral/brain data .
Pragmatically , however , the space of plausible generative models considered is dramatically limited by the set of models with known likelihood functions .
For many models , the lack of a closed-form likelihood typically impedes Bayesian inference methods .
As a result , standard models are evaluated for convenience , even when other models might be superior .
Likelihood-free methods exist but are limited by their computational cost or their restriction to particular inference scenarios .
Here , we propose neural networks that learn approximate likelihoods for arbitrary generative models , allowing fast posterior sampling with only a one-off cost for model simulations that is amortized for future inference .
We show that these methods can accurately recover posterior parameter distributions for a variety of neurocognitive process models .
We provide code allowing users to deploy these methods for arbitrary hierarchical model instantiations without further training .

This article discusses how scientists use computer models to understand how the brain works. These models can help compare different theories and explain what's happening in our brains. However, creating these models can be difficult and time-consuming. Scientists have come up with ways to make it easier, but some methods are limited and not always accurate. In this study, researchers propose a new method that uses artificial intelligence to quickly and accurately analyze brain data. They believe this new approach will help scientists better understand how the brain works and ultimately lead to new treatments for brain-related diseases. They also provide tools for other scientists to use this method in their research.


134 Optogenetic dissection of mitotic spindle positioning in vivo

The position of the mitotic spindle determines the plane of cell cleavage , and thereby daughter cell location , size , and content .
Spindle positioning is driven by dynein-mediated pulling forces exerted on astral microtubules , which requires an evolutionarily conserved complex of Gα∙GDP , GPR-1/2Pins/LGN , and LIN-5Mud/NuMA proteins .
To examine individual functions of the complex components , we developed a genetic strategy for light-controlled localization of endogenous proteins in C . elegans embryos .
By replacing Gα and GPR-1/2 with a light-inducible membrane anchor , we demonstrate that Gα∙GDP , Gα∙GTP , and GPR-1/2 are not required for pulling-force generation .
In the absence of Gα and GPR-1/2 , cortical recruitment of LIN-5 , but not dynein itself , induced high pulling forces .
The light-controlled localization of LIN-5 overruled normal cell-cycle and polarity regulation and provided experimental control over the spindle and cell-cleavage plane .
Our results define Gα∙GDP–GPR-1/2Pins/LGN as a regulatable membrane anchor , and LIN-5Mud/NuMA as a potent activator of dynein-dependent spindle-positioning forces .

This study is about how cells divide and how certain proteins help determine where the dividing cells end up. The proteins work together to generate pulling forces that position the cell's "mitotic spindle," which determines how the cell will divide. The researchers developed a way to control the proteins using light in worms, and found that one particular protein called LIN-5 was especially important for generating those pulling forces. These results help us better understand the complicated process of cell division, and how we might control it in the future.


135 Selections that isolate recombinant mitochondrial genomes in animals

Homologous recombination is widespread and catalyzes evolution .
Nonetheless , its existence in animal mitochondrial DNA is questioned .
We designed selections for recombination between co-resident mitochondrial genomes in various heteroplasmic Drosophila lines .
In four experimental settings , recombinant genomes became the sole or dominant genome in the progeny .
Thus , selection uncovers occurrence of homologous recombination in Drosophila mtDNA and documents its functional benefit .
Double-strand breaks enhanced recombination in the germline and revealed somatic recombination .
When the recombination partner was a diverged Drosophila melanogaster genome or a genome from a different species such as Drosophila yakuba , sequencing revealed long continuous stretches of exchange .
In addition , the distribution of sequence polymorphisms in recombinants allowed us to map a selected trait to a particular region in the Drosophila mitochondrial genome .
Thus , recombination can be harnessed to dissect function and evolution of mitochondrial genome .

In simple terms, scientists have found a way to create a better understanding of how genetic traits are passed down in tiny energy-producing structures called mitochondria. They did this by studying the DNA of fruit flies and found evidence that contradicts previous beliefs about how DNA is copied. They discovered that when two different variations of DNA were present in the same cell, they could combine and create a new version. This could help improve our knowledge of how genetics affect different traits.


136 Chimeric antigen receptors that trigger phagocytosis

Chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ) are synthetic receptors that reprogram T cells to kill cancer .
The success of CAR-T cell therapies highlights the promise of programmed immunity and suggests that applying CAR strategies to other immune cell lineages may be beneficial .
Here , we engineered a family of Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis ( CAR-Ps ) that direct macrophages to engulf specific targets , including cancer cells .
CAR-Ps consist of an extracellular antibody fragment , which can be modified to direct CAR-P activity towards specific antigens .
By screening a panel of engulfment receptor intracellular domains , we found that the cytosolic domains from Megf10 and FcRɣ robustly triggered engulfment independently of their native extracellular domain .
We show that CAR-Ps drive specific engulfment of antigen-coated synthetic particles and whole human cancer cells .
Addition of a tandem PI3K recruitment domain increased cancer cell engulfment .
Finally , we show that CAR-P expressing murine macrophages reduce cancer cell number in co-culture by over 40% .

Scientists have made progress in creating new treatments to fight cancer by using synthetic receptors called Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs). These receptors retrain our immune cells to specifically attack cancer cells. This approach has proved successful, and now researchers are looking at applying CAR strategies to other immune cells. An example of this is the development of CAR-Ps, a new type of receptor that helps macrophages, another type of immune cell, to engulf and attack cancer cells. CAR-Ps can be engineered to target specific antigens (the markers on the surface of cancer cells). The use of CAR-Ps resulted in a drastic reduction in cancer cells, demonstrating the potential of this new approach as an effective treatment for cancer.


137 Distinct modes of SMAD2 chromatin binding and remodeling shape the transcriptional response to NODAL/Activin signaling

NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2 .
How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however , is not known .
Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation , and the mechanisms underlying them .
NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes , and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2 , acting via multiple mechanisms .
Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding .
SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites .
However , it also binds to unacetylated , closed chromatin , independently of pioneer factors , where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation .
For a subset of genes , this requires SMARCA4 .
We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling .
Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics , and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program .

During the early stages of life, our cells work together to create an embryo. The communication pathway responsible for organizing this process is called NODAL/Activin signaling, which involves a protein called SMAD2. Scientists have been puzzled on how SMAD2 activates specific genes at certain times. However, after conducting experiments, we have found out that SMAD2 is responsible for modifying the way DNA is packaged within cells, which affects which genes are activated. Additionally, we have discovered that SMAD2 has two different methods of binding to DNA. One way SMAD2 binds to DNA is by attaching to existing open sites, whereas the other way is by opening up previously unaccessible areas. Moreover, we have found that the transcriptional program is not a straightforward process, meaning that SMAD2 does not always lead to immediate changes in gene expression. Our research suggests that SMAD2 needs the help of other proteins over time to ensure that the right genes are activated.


138 Identification of human TERT elements necessary for telomerase recruitment to telomeres

Human chromosomes terminate in telomeres , repetitive DNA sequences bound by the shelterin complex .
Shelterin protects chromosome ends , prevents recognition by the DNA damage machinery , and recruits telomerase .
A patch of amino acids , termed the TEL-patch , on the OB-fold domain of the shelterin component TPP1 is essential to recruit telomerase to telomeres .
In contrast , the site on telomerase that interacts with the TPP1 OB-fold is not well defined .
In this study , we identify separation-of-function mutations in the TEN-domain of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) that disrupt the interaction of telomerase with TPP1 in vivo and in vitro but have very little effect on the catalytic activity of telomerase .
Suppression of a TEN-domain mutation with a compensatory charge-swap mutation in the TEL-patch indicates that their association is direct .
Our findings define the interaction interface required for telomerase recruitment to telomeres , an important step towards developing modulators of this interaction as therapeutics for human disease .

Human chromosomes have a special ending called telomeres, which are protected by a group of molecules called shelterin. This group shields the chromosome ending from harm and helps recruit another molecule, called telomerase, which helps maintain the telomere. Scientists have found a small part of one of the shelterin molecules, called the TEL-patch, that is really important for bringing in telomerase. The part of telomerase that talks to the TEL-patch isn't well understood. In this study, researchers found specific changes in another part of telomerase that mess up its ability to talk to shelterin, but don't hurt its other job of helping maintain the telomere. By studying these changes, the scientists were able to identify how telomerase interacts with shelterin, which is important for developing new treatments for diseases that affect telomeres.


139 Large-scale whole genome sequencing of M. tuberculosis provides insights into transmission in a high prevalence area

To improve understanding of the factors influencing tuberculosis transmission and the role of pathogen variation , we sequenced all available specimens from patients diagnosed over 15 years in a whole district in Malawi .
Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages were assigned and transmission networks constructed , allowing ≤10 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) difference .
We defined disease as due to recent infection if the network-determined source was within 5 years , and assessed transmissibility from forward transmissions resulting in disease .
High-quality sequences were available for 1687 disease episodes ( 72% of all culture-positive episodes ) : 66% of patients linked to at least one other patient .
The between-patient mutation rate was 0 . 26 SNPs/year ( 95% CI 0 . 21–0 . 31 ) .
We showed striking differences by lineage in the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and in transmissibility ( highest for lineage-2 and lowest for lineage-1 ) that were not confounded by immigration , HIV status or drug resistance .
Transmissions resulting in disease decreased markedly over time .

We studied how tuberculosis spreads in a district in Malawi by looking at samples from patients over 15 years. We found which strains of the bacteria were being passed from person to person and how closely related they were. We also looked at how easily the disease was spreading and which strains were causing the most cases. We found that some strains of the bacteria were more likely to spread than others and this was not influenced by factors like HIV or drug resistance. Over time, fewer people were getting sick from the disease.


140 Head-to-tail interactions of the coiled-coil domains regulate ClpB activity and cooperation with Hsp70 in protein disaggregation

The hexameric AAA+ chaperone ClpB reactivates aggregated proteins in cooperation with the Hsp70 system .
Essential for disaggregation , the ClpB middle domain ( MD ) is a coiled-coil propeller that binds Hsp70 .
Although the ClpB subunit structure is known , positioning of the MD in the hexamer and its mechanism of action are unclear .
We obtained electron microscopy ( EM ) structures of the BAP variant of ClpB that binds the protease ClpP , clearly revealing MD density on the surface of the ClpB ring .
Mutant analysis and asymmetric reconstructions show that MDs adopt diverse positions in a single ClpB hexamer .
Adjacent , horizontally oriented MDs form head-to-tail contacts and repress ClpB activity by preventing Hsp70 interaction .
Tilting of the MD breaks this contact , allowing Hsp70 binding , and releasing the contact in adjacent subunits .
Our data suggest a wavelike activation of ClpB subunits around the ring .

Researchers have discovered how a group of proteins called ClpB work together with Hsp70 to restore damaged proteins. ClpB has a middle section called MD that binds to Hsp70, allowing it to do its job of clearing up damaged proteins. Although scientists already knew the structure of the ClpB protein, they didn't know how the MD section worked. By using advanced electron microscopy techniques, the researchers found that MD sections are positioned in various places within a single ClpB protein. When the MD section tilts, it breaks the contact between adjacent subunits and allows Hsp70 to bind and repair damaged proteins. Overall, ClpB operates like a wave of protein activation around the ring.


141 The magnesium transporter A is activated by cardiolipin and is highly sensitive to free magnesium in vitro

The magnesium transporter A ( MgtA ) is a specialized P-type ATPase , believed to import Mg2+ into the cytoplasm .
In Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the virulence determining two-component system PhoQ/PhoP regulates the transcription of mgtA gene by sensing Mg2+ concentrations in the periplasm .
However , the factors that affect MgtA function are not known .
This study demonstrates , for the first time , that MgtA is highly dependent on anionic phospholipids and in particular , cardiolipin .
Colocalization studies confirm that MgtA is found in the cardiolipin lipid domains in the membrane .
The head group of cardiolipin plays major role in activation of MgtA suggesting that cardiolipin may act as a Mg2+ chaperone for MgtA .
We further show that MgtA is highly sensitive to free Mg2+ ( Mg2+free ) levels in the solution .
MgtA is activated when the Mg2+free concentration is reduced below 10 μM and is strongly inhibited above 1 mM , indicating that Mg2+free acts as product inhibitor .
Combined , our findings conclude that MgtA may act as a sensor as well as a transporter of Mg2+ .

This study looked at how the magnesium transporter A (MgtA) works in bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli. The researchers found that MgtA needs a type of molecule called anionic phospholipids, especially one called cardiolipin, to function properly. They also discovered that MgtA is sensitive to levels of free magnesium in its surroundings, and can "sense" and transport magnesium ions. Overall, this research helps us understand more about the ways bacteria work and how they can cause illness.


142 Mapping the zoonotic niche of Ebola virus disease in Africa

Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) is a complex zoonosis that is highly virulent in humans .
The largest recorded outbreak of EVD is ongoing in West Africa , outside of its previously reported and predicted niche .
We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates ( 1976–2014 ) .
Using species distribution models , these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa .
Vegetation , elevation , temperature , evapotranspiration , and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship .
At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however , the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans .
Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of EVD in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past .

The Ebola virus disease is a dangerous illness that can be passed from animals to humans. The worst outbreak of this disease is happening right now in West Africa, even though it was previously only found in certain areas. Scientists have looked at where the disease has been found before and made predictions about where it could spread in the future. They found that certain factors like vegetation, temperature, and the presence of bats can help predict where the disease might spread next. Although there are many people who live in areas that are at risk, it is still unlikely that they will get sick. However, as more and more people travel internationally, there is a greater chance that the disease could spread quickly in the future.


143 Maternally provided LSD1/KDM1A enables the maternal-to-zygotic transition and prevents defects that manifest postnatally

Somatic cell nuclear transfer has established that the oocyte contains maternal factors with epigenetic reprogramming capacity .
Yet the identity and function of these maternal factors during the gamete to embryo transition remains poorly understood .
In C . elegans , LSD1/KDM1A enables this transition by removing H3K4me2 and preventing the transgenerational inheritance of transcription patterns .
Here we show that loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A in mice results in embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage , with arrested embryos failing to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition .
This suggests that LSD1/KDM1A maternal reprogramming is conserved .
Moreover , partial loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A results in striking phenotypes weeks after fertilization; including perinatal lethality and abnormal behavior in surviving adults .
These maternal effect hypomorphic phenotypes are associated with alterations in DNA methylation and expression at imprinted genes .
These results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where defects in early epigenetic reprogramming can lead to defects that manifest later in development .

Scientists have found that eggs contain important factors that help develop an embryo. However, they don't know much about these factors' identity or what they do during the process. In a tiny worm species and in mice, researchers discovered that a specific factor, called LSD1/KDM1A, is essential during early development. Without enough of it, mouse embryos can't develop properly and may die at an early stage or show abnormalities later on. These findings teach us more about the importance of early development for healthy growth in mammals.


144 Cross-talk between PRMT1-mediated methylation and ubiquitylation on RBM15 controls RNA splicing

RBM15 , an RNA binding protein , determines cell-fate specification of many tissues including blood .
We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 ( PRMT1 ) at residue R578 , leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase ( CNOT4 ) .
Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level .
Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression .
At the molecular level , RBM15 binds to pre-messenger RNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1 , RUNX1 , TAL1 and c-MPL .
Furthermore , preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing .
Therefore , PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration .
Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia .

The protein RBM15 plays an important role in deciding what type of cells our body makes, including blood cells. Scientists have found that another protein, PRMT1, can harm RBM15 by adding a molecule called a methyl group to it. This leads to the destruction of RBM15 and stops a type of blood cell from developing properly. However, the scientists found that if they stopped PRMT1 from harming RBM15, the blood cell could develop normally again. RBM15 also helps control how some genes are read in cells, and PRMT1 can change this too. The scientists think that a possible way to treat a certain type of leukemia could be to block PRMT1 from causing these problems with RBM15.


145 Dissecting the sharp response of a canonical developmental enhancer reveals multiple sources of cooperativity

Developmental enhancers integrate graded concentrations of transcription factors ( TFs ) to create sharp gene expression boundaries .
Here we examine the hunchback P2 ( HbP2 ) enhancer which drives a sharp expression pattern in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo in response to the transcriptional activator Bicoid ( Bcd ) .
We systematically interrogate cis and trans factors that influence the shape and position of expression driven by HbP2 , and find that the prevailing model , based on pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd to HbP2 is not adequate .
We demonstrate that other proteins , such as pioneer factors , Mediator and histone modifiers influence the shape and position of the HbP2 expression pattern .
Comparing our results to theory reveals how higher-order cooperativity and energy expenditure impact boundary location and sharpness .
Our results emphasize that the bacterial view of transcription regulation , where pairwise interactions between regulatory proteins dominate , must be reexamined in animals , where multiple molecular mechanisms collaborate to shape the gene regulatory function .

Scientists are studying how genes turn on and off during early development in flies. They focused on a gene called hunchback P2 and found that a protein called Bicoid helps it turn on in a specific area of the embryo. They also found that other proteins, including pioneer factors, Mediator, and histone modifiers, also play important roles in controlling the gene's expression. The researchers learned that animal gene regulation is more complicated than previously thought and involves multiple molecular mechanisms.


146 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells control dengue and Chikungunya virus infections via IRF7-regulated interferon responses

Type I interferon ( IFN-I ) responses are critical for the control of RNA virus infections , however , many viruses , including Dengue ( DENV ) and Chikungunya ( CHIKV ) virus , do not directly activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) , robust IFN-I producing cells .
Herein , we demonstrated that DENV and CHIKV infected cells are sensed by pDCs , indirectly , resulting in selective IRF7 activation and IFN-I production , in the absence of other inflammatory cytokine responses .
To elucidate pDC immunomodulatory functions , we developed a mouse model in which IRF7 signaling is restricted to pDC .
Despite undetectable levels of IFN-I protein , pDC-restricted IRF7 signaling controlled both viruses and was sufficient to protect mice from lethal CHIKV infection .
Early pDC IRF7-signaling resulted in amplification of downstream antiviral responses , including an accelerated natural killer ( NK ) cell-mediated type II IFN response .
These studies revealed the dominant , yet indirect role of pDC IRF7-signaling in directing both type I and II IFN responses during arbovirus infections .

This study looked at how our immune system responds to viruses like Dengue and Chikungunya. It turns out that certain cells in our immune system, called pDCs, can indirectly detect and activate a response to these viruses. By studying mice, the researchers found that pDCs play a really important role in protecting us from these kinds of infections, even if we don't see a big increase in one specific type of immune response. This research could help us develop better treatments for these infections in the future.


147 Calcium imaging with genetically encoded indicators in behaving primates

Understanding the neural basis of behaviour requires studying brain activity in behaving subjects using complementary techniques that measure neural responses at multiple spatial scales , and developing computational tools for understanding the mapping between these measurements .
Here we report the first results of widefield imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator ( GCaMP6f ) signals from V1 of behaving macaques .
This technique provides a robust readout of visual population responses at the columnar scale over multiple mm2 and over several months .
To determine the quantitative relation between the widefield GCaMP signals and the locally pooled spiking activity , we developed a computational model that sums the responses of V1 neurons characterized by prior single unit measurements .
The measured tuning properties of the GCaMP signals to stimulus contrast , orientation and spatial position closely match the predictions of the model , suggesting that widefield GCaMP signals are linearly related to the summed local spiking activity .

To understand how the brain works, scientists need to study how different parts of the brain respond to different behaviors. They use many different tools to do this and try to understand how these tools are related to each other. In this study, researchers are studying how visual signals in the brain of macaque monkeys are related to how those monkeys behave. These signals can be measured using a special technique called widefield imaging. The researchers also developed a computer program to help them analyze the signals and understand how they relate to the monkeys' behavior. The researchers found that the signals they measured matched their expectations, which suggests that this technique could be useful for studying how other parts of the brain respond to different behaviors too.


148 An evidence based hypothesis on the existence of two pathways of mitochondrial crista formation

Metabolic function and architecture of mitochondria are intimately linked .
More than 60 years ago , cristae were discovered as characteristic elements of mitochondria that harbor the protein complexes of oxidative phosphorylation , but how cristae are formed , remained an open question .
Here we present experimental results obtained with yeast that support a novel hypothesis on the existence of two molecular pathways that lead to the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae .
Formation of lamellar cristae depends on the mitochondrial fusion machinery through a pathway that is required also for homeostasis of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA .
Tubular cristae are formed via invaginations of the inner boundary membrane by a pathway independent of the fusion machinery .
Dimerization of the F1FO-ATP synthase and the presence of the MICOS complex are necessary for both pathways .
The proposed hypothesis is suggested to apply also to higher eukaryotes , since the key components are conserved in structure and function throughout evolution .

Mitochondria are important parts of cells that are responsible for making energy. They have a special structure called cristae that helps them do their job, but scientists didn't know how these cristae formed. In this study, researchers used yeast to discover two ways that cristae can form - one through a process called fusion that helps keep the mitochondria healthy, and another through an invagination of the membrane. This happens with the help of certain proteins in the mitochondria that are found in many different organisms.


149 The proposed channel-enzyme transient receptor potential melastatin 2 does not possess ADP ribose hydrolase activity

Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 ( TRPM2 ) is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel essential for immunocyte activation , insulin secretion , and postischemic cell death .
TRPM2 is activated by ADP ribose ( ADPR ) binding to its C-terminal cytosolic NUDT9-homology ( NUDT9H ) domain , homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase ( ADPRase ) NUDT9 .
Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme , but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further investigations .
Here we developed a soluble NUDT9H model using chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of NUDT9H and NUDT9 .
When expressed in E . coli , chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified .
In ADPRase assays the conserved Nudix-box sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity ( kcat~4-9s-1 ) , that of NUDT9H did not support catalysis .
Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating ( K1/2~1-5 μM ) , confirming functionality of chimeric domains .
Thus , TRPM2 is not a 'chanzyme' .
Chimeras provide convenient soluble NUDT9H models for structural/biochemical studies .

TRPM2 is a special channel in our body that helps activate our immune system, release insulin, and heal our cells after an injury. It is activated by a molecule called ADPR, which binds to a part of the protein called NUDT9H. Scientists have been interested in studying NUDT9H to better understand how this channel works, but it has been difficult because it is not soluble. In this study, scientists created a new type of NUDT9H that was soluble by combining it with parts of another molecule. This new molecule allowed them to study the function of NUDT9H and confirm that TRPM2 is not a "chanzyme", meaning it is not both a channel and an enzyme. This new method can be used by scientists to study NUDT9H in more detail in the future.


150 Characterization of the finch embryo supports evolutionary conservation of the naive stage of development in amniotes

Innate pluripotency of mouse embryos transits from naive to primed state as the inner cell mass differentiates into epiblast .
In vitro , their counterparts are embryonic ( ESCs ) and epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) , respectively .
Activation of the FGF signaling cascade results in mouse ESCs differentiating into mEpiSCs , indicative of its requirement in the shift between these states .
However , only mouse ESCs correspond to the naive state; ESCs from other mammals and from chick show primed state characteristics .
Thus , the significance of the naive state is unclear .
In this study , we use zebra finch as a model for comparative ESC studies .
The finch blastoderm has mESC-like properties , while chick blastoderm exhibits EpiSC features .
In the absence of FGF signaling , finch cells retained expression of pluripotent markers , which were lost in cells from chick or aged finch epiblasts .
Our data suggest that the naive state of pluripotency is evolutionarily conserved among amniotes .

This study looked at the pluripotency of different types of stem cells in mouse embryos, and how they change as the inner cell mass develops. In the lab, we can create similar cells called embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). We found that a signaling pathway called FGF is important for the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. However, only mouse ESCs are in the naive state, while those from other animals are in the primed state. We wanted to see if this is the same in birds, so we looked at zebra finch and chick embryos. We found that the finch cells are more like mouse ESCs, while chick cells are more like EpiSCs. Our research suggests that the naive state of pluripotency is important and conserved among different animals.


151 Hippocampal activation is associated with longitudinal amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline

The amyloid hypothesis suggests that beta-amyloid ( Aβ ) deposition leads to alterations in neural function and ultimately to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease .
However , factors that underlie Aβ deposition are incompletely understood .
One proposed model suggests that synaptic activity leads to increased Aβ deposition .
More specifically , hyperactivity in the hippocampus may be detrimental and could be one factor that drives Aβ deposition .
To test this model , we examined the relationship between hippocampal activity during a memory task using fMRI and subsequent longitudinal change in Aβ using PIB-PET imaging in cognitively normal older adults .
We found that greater hippocampal activation at baseline was associated with increased Aβ accumulation .
Furthermore , increasing Aβ accumulation mediated the influence of hippocampal activation on declining memory performance , demonstrating a crucial role of Aβ in linking hippocampal activation and memory .
These findings support a model linking increased hippocampal activation to subsequent Aβ deposition and cognitive decline .

Researchers have been studying why people develop Alzheimer's disease, a condition that causes cognitive decline. One theory is called the amyloid hypothesis, and it suggests that a protein called beta-amyloid causes changes in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's disease. However, we don't know everything about why beta-amyloid deposits in the brain happen. One idea is that more activity in the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for memory, makes deposits of beta-amyloid more likely. In this study, scientists looked at brain scans from older adults with no symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. They found that when the hippocampus was more active during a memory task, the person was more likely to have beta-amyloid deposits later on. Those deposits then led to memory problems. These findings suggest that keeping the hippocampus activity low could be important to prevent Alzheimer's disease.


152 Human and nonhuman primate meninges harbor lymphatic vessels that can be visualized noninvasively by MRI

Here , we report the existence of meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman primates ( common marmoset monkeys ) and the feasibility of noninvasively imaging and mapping them in vivo with high-resolution , clinical MRI .
On T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted black-blood imaging , lymphatic vessels enhance with gadobutrol , a gadolinium-based contrast agent with high propensity to extravasate across a permeable capillary endothelial barrier , but not with gadofosveset , a blood-pool contrast agent .
The topography of these vessels , running alongside dural venous sinuses , recapitulates the meningeal lymphatic system of rodents .
In primates , meningeal lymphatics display a typical panel of lymphatic endothelial markers by immunohistochemistry .
This discovery holds promise for better understanding the normal physiology of lymphatic drainage from the central nervous system and potential aberrations in neurological diseases .

We found evidence of lymphatic vessels in the brains of humans and monkeys. Using clinical MRI, we were able to map these vessels without invasive procedures. By enhancing the images with a contrast agent called gadobutrol, we could see the vessels running alongside veins in the brain. This pattern is similar to what's seen in rodents. We also discovered that these vessels have the same markers as other lymphatic vessels in the body. This discovery helps us better understand how the brain's lymphatic system works and could lead to better treatments for neurological diseases.


153 Single cell analysis reveals human cytomegalovirus drives latently infected cells towards an anergic-like monocyte state

Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) causes a lifelong infection through establishment of latency .
Although reactivation from latency can cause life-threatening disease , our molecular understanding of HCMV latency is incomplete .
Here we use single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize latency in monocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) .
In monocytes , we identify host cell surface markers that enable enrichment of latent cells harboring higher viral transcript levels , which can reactivate more efficiently , and are characterized by reduced intrinsic immune response that is important for viral gene expression .
Significantly , in latent HSPCs , viral transcripts could be detected only in monocyte progenitors and were also associated with reduced immune-response .
Overall , our work indicates that regardless of the developmental stage in which HCMV infects , HCMV drives hematopoietic cells towards a weaker immune-responsive monocyte state and that this anergic-like state is crucial for the virus ability to express its transcripts and to eventually reactivate .

This study looked at how a virus called human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause lifelong infections and sometimes life-threatening diseases by remaining hidden inside certain cells in the body. The researchers used a new technique to look at individual cells and found that the virus changes these cells in a way that makes them less able to fight infections. This allows the virus to hide and grow, leading to possible reactivation and illness. These findings help us understand how the virus works and how we might be able to develop better treatments.


154 Limited dishevelled/Axin oligomerization determines efficiency of Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction

In Wnt/β-catenin signaling , the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin is regulated by its phosphorylation in a complex that includes the scaffold protein Axin and associated kinases .
Wnt binding to its coreceptors activates the cytosolic effector Dishevelled ( Dvl ) , leading to the recruitment of Axin and the inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation .
This process requires interaction of homologous DIX domains present in Dvl and Axin , but is mechanistically undefined .
We show that Dvl DIX forms antiparallel , double-stranded oligomers in vitro , and that Dvl in cells forms oligomers typically <10 molecules at endogenous expression levels .
Axin DIX ( DAX ) forms small single-stranded oligomers , but its self-association is stronger than that of DIX .
DAX caps the ends of DIX oligomers , such that a DIX oligomer has at most four DAX binding sites .
The relative affinities and stoichiometry of the DIX-DAX interaction provide a mechanism for efficient inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation upon Axin recruitment to the Wnt receptor complex .

This study looked at how a protein called β-catenin is controlled in a process called Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The researchers found that when a molecule called Wnt binds to its receptors, it leads to the recruitment of another protein called Axin, which stops β-catenin from being phosphorylated. They also discovered that two proteins, Dvl and Axin, interact in a specific way to make sure that this process works efficiently. The researchers found that Dvl forms oligomers (groups of molecules) and that Axin caps the ends of these groups, which helps to stop β-catenin from being phosphorylated. This is important for understanding how cells work and how to develop new treatments for diseases.


155 C-terminal threonines and serines play distinct roles in the desensitization of rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor

Rod photoreceptors generate measurable responses to single-photon activation of individual molecules of the G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) , rhodopsin .
Timely rhodopsin desensitization depends on phosphorylation and arrestin binding , which quenches G protein activation .
Rhodopsin phosphorylation has been measured biochemically at C-terminal serine residues , suggesting that these residues are critical for producing fast , low-noise responses .
The role of native threonine residues is unclear .
We compared single-photon responses from rhodopsin lacking native serine or threonine phosphorylation sites .
Contrary to expectation , serine-only rhodopsin generated prolonged step-like single-photon responses that terminated abruptly and randomly , whereas threonine-only rhodopsin generated responses that were only modestly slower than normal .
We show that the step-like responses of serine-only rhodopsin reflect slow and stochastic arrestin binding .
Thus , threonine sites play a privileged role in promoting timely arrestin binding and rhodopsin desensitization .
Similar coordination of phosphorylation and arrestin binding may more generally permit tight control of the duration of GPCR activity .

This study looked at how our eyes respond to light at the molecular level. Specifically, the researchers studied a protein called rhodopsin which helps us see in low light. They found that when rhodopsin gets activated by a single photon, other molecules in our eyes help turn off that activation. The researchers found that certain parts of the rhodopsin protein are important for this process. They tested how rhodopsin responded without these parts and found that it caused some strange and unpredictable reactions. They concluded that these specific parts of the rhodopsin protein play an important role in our ability to see in low light. This research could help us better understand how this process works and potentially help with vision-related diseases.


156 Subterranean mammals show convergent regression in ocular genes and enhancers, along with adaptation to tunneling

The underground environment imposes unique demands on life that have led subterranean species to evolve specialized traits , many of which evolved convergently .
We studied convergence in evolutionary rate in subterranean mammals in order to associate phenotypic evolution with specific genetic regions .
We identified a strong excess of vision- and skin-related genes that changed at accelerated rates in the subterranean environment due to relaxed constraint and adaptive evolution .
We also demonstrate that ocular-specific transcriptional enhancers were convergently accelerated , whereas enhancers active outside the eye were not .
Furthermore , several uncharacterized genes and regulatory sequences demonstrated convergence and thus constitute novel candidate sequences for congenital ocular disorders .
The strong evidence of convergence in these species indicates that evolution in this environment is recurrent and predictable and can be used to gain insights into phenotype–genotype relationships .

Animals that live underground face unique challenges that have caused them to evolve special features. We wanted to know how these features developed in subterranean mammals by studying their DNA. We found that genes relating to eyes and skin were more likely to change quickly in underground environments. We also found that certain genes that control eye development changed in similar ways in different species, showing that evolution in these environments is predictable. We discovered previously unknown genes that might be involved in eye problems. Our study can help us understand how animals adapt to their environment and how this leads to changes in their physical traits.


157 A new family of StART domain proteins at membrane contact sites has a role in ER-PM sterol transport

Sterol traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and plasma membrane ( PM ) is a fundamental cellular process that occurs by a poorly understood non-vesicular mechanism .
We identified a novel , evolutionarily diverse family of ER membrane proteins with StART-like lipid transfer domains and studied them in yeast .
StART-like domains from Ysp2p and its paralog Lam4p specifically bind sterols , and Ysp2p , Lam4p and their homologs Ysp1p and Sip3p target punctate ER-PM contact sites distinct from those occupied by known ER-PM tethers .
The activity of Ysp2p , reflected in amphotericin-sensitivity assays , requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned so that it can reach across ER-PM contacts .
Absence of Ysp2p , Ysp1p or Sip3p reduces the rate at which exogenously supplied sterols traffic from the PM to the ER .
Our data suggest that these StART-like proteins act in trans to mediate a step in sterol exchange between the PM and ER .

Scientists have discovered a new family of proteins that play an important role in the way our cells move sterols (a type of lipid) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (PM). This process is essential for normal cell function but not well understood. The proteins, called Ysp2p, Lam4p, Ysp1p and Sip3p, bind to sterols and are located at specific sites between the ER and PM. Ysp2p activity is particularly important and requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned correctly to work properly. When these proteins are absent, the movement of sterols from the PM to the ER is reduced. Overall, this research helps us to better understand the complicated processes that go on inside our cells.


158 Coupling of remote alternating-access transport mechanisms for protons and substrates in the multidrug efflux pump AcrB

Membrane transporters of the RND superfamily confer multidrug resistance to pathogenic bacteria , and are essential for cholesterol metabolism and embryonic development in humans .
We use high-resolution X-ray crystallography and computational methods to delineate the mechanism of the homotrimeric RND-type proton/drug antiporter AcrB , the active component of the major efflux system AcrAB-TolC in Escherichia coli , and one most complex and intriguing membrane transporters known to date .
Analysis of wildtype AcrB and four functionally-inactive variants reveals an unprecedented mechanism that involves two remote alternating-access conformational cycles within each protomer , namely one for protons in the transmembrane region and another for drugs in the periplasmic domain , 50 Å apart .
Each of these cycles entails two distinct types of collective motions of two structural repeats , coupled by flanking α-helices that project from the membrane .
Moreover , we rationalize how the cross-talk among protomers across the trimerization interface might lead to a more kinetically efficient efflux system .

This study looks at how certain proteins called "membrane transporters" are used by bacteria to resist multiple drugs and how they help human bodies process cholesterol and develop properly. The researchers used advanced techniques to study one specific type of these transporters in bacteria, which is very complex. They discovered that this transporter goes through two different cycles to move protons and drugs across the cell membrane, and that these movements are controlled by certain parts of the protein. They also think that the way these transporters work together could make them even more effective at removing drugs from bacteria cells.


159 Parallel evolution of influenza across multiple spatiotemporal scales

Viral variants that arise in the global influenza population begin as de novo mutations in single infected hosts , but the evolutionary dynamics that transform within-host variation to global genetic diversity are poorly understood .
Here , we demonstrate that influenza evolution within infected humans recapitulates many evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale .
We deep-sequence longitudinal samples from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections .
We find parallel evolution across three scales: within individual patients , in different patients in our study , and in the global influenza population .
In hemagglutinin , a small set of mutations arises independently in multiple patients .
These same mutations emerge repeatedly within single patients and compete with one another , providing a vivid clinical example of clonal interference .
Many of these recurrent within-host mutations also reach a high global frequency in the decade following the patient infections .
Our results demonstrate surprising concordance in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales .

We studied how the flu virus evolves in people who have long-term infections, and found that the same mutations that arise within one person can also appear in others and even spread globally. We looked at the genetic material of four patients with H3N2 flu over a long period of time and saw that certain mutations appeared in multiple patients independently. These mutations, which competed with each other within individual patients, also became common across the globe in the following years. Our findings show that the evolutionary dynamics of the flu virus are similar across different scales of time and space.


160 Molecular mechanism to target the endosomal Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure

During autophagy , a newly formed double membrane surrounds its cargo to generate the so-called autophagosome , which then fuses with a lysosome after closure .
Previous work implicated that endosomal Rab7/Ypt7 associates to autophagosomes prior to their fusion with lysosomes .
Here , we unravel how the Mon1-Ccz1 guanosine exchange factor ( GEF ) acting upstream of Ypt7 is specifically recruited to the pre-autophagosomal structure under starvation conditions .
We find that Mon1-Ccz1 directly binds to Atg8 , the yeast homolog of the members of the mammalian LC3 protein family .
This requires at least one LIR motif in the Ccz1 C-terminus , which is essential for autophagy but not for endosomal transport .
In agreement , only wild-type , but not LIR-mutated Mon1-Ccz1 promotes Atg8-dependent activation of Ypt7 .
Our data reveal how GEF targeting can specify the fate of a newly formed organelle and provide new insights into the regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion .

Autophagy is a process in cells that helps to get rid of waste or damaged parts. It does this by creating an autophagosome, which is like a little sack that surrounds the waste and brings it to a lysosome, which can break it down. Previous research showed that a protein called Rab7/Ypt7 is involved in helping the autophagosome fuse with the lysosome. Now, scientists have discovered another protein called Mon1-Ccz1 that helps Rab7/Ypt7 do its job. Mon1-Ccz1 sticks to another protein called Atg8, which is crucial for autophagy, and this helps Rab7/Ypt7 work better. By understanding how these proteins work together, we can learn more about how cells get rid of waste and stay healthy.


161 A novel optical microscope for imaging large embryos and tissue volumes with sub-cellular resolution throughout

Current optical microscope objectives of low magnification have low numerical aperture and therefore have too little depth resolution and discrimination to perform well in confocal and nonlinear microscopy .
This is a serious limitation in important areas , including the phenotypic screening of human genes in transgenic mice by study of embryos undergoing advanced organogenesis .
We have built an optical lens system for 3D imaging of objects up to 6 mm wide and 3 mm thick with depth resolution of only a few microns instead of the tens of microns currently attained , allowing sub-cellular detail to be resolved throughout the volume .
We present this lens , called the Mesolens , with performance data and images from biological specimens including confocal images of whole fixed and intact fluorescently-stained 12 . 5-day old mouse embryos .

Current microscope lenses used for studying very small things aren't good enough for certain types of research, such as looking at the genes in developing mice. They don't have enough detail and can't show things deep inside the sample. We built a new lens system that can image objects that are up to 6mm wide and 3mm thick with incredible detail. We call it the Mesolens and it can show sub-cellular details throughout the whole sample, not just on the surface. We have used it to look at fixed and fluorescently stained mouse embryos and have some really cool pictures to share.


162 Yolk-sac-derived macrophages progressively expand in the mouse kidney with age

Renal macrophages represent a highly heterogeneous and specialized population of myeloid cells with mixed developmental origins from the yolk-sac and hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) .
They promote both injury and repair by regulating inflammation , angiogenesis , and tissue remodeling .
Recent reports highlight differential roles for ontogenically distinct renal macrophage populations in disease .
However , little is known about how these populations change over time in normal , uninjured kidneys .
Prior reports demonstrated a high proportion of HSC-derived macrophages in the young adult kidney .
Unexpectedly , using genetic fate-mapping and parabiosis studies , we found that yolk-sac-derived macrophages progressively expand in number with age and become a major contributor to the renal macrophage population in older mice .
This chronological shift in macrophage composition involves local cellular proliferation and recruitment from circulating progenitors and may contribute to the distinct immune responses , limited reparative capacity , and increased disease susceptibility of kidneys in the elderly population .

The kidneys are an important organ responsible for filtering waste from the body. They have special cells called renal macrophages that play a role in both causing and repairing damage. These cells come from different parts of the body and have different functions. Although we know that young kidneys have a lot of one type of macrophage, we recently discovered that older kidneys have more of a different type. This change happens because the new type of macrophage grows and moves into the kidneys as we age. This shift in the types of macrophages in our kidneys may contribute to a weaker immune system, less ability to repair damage, and a higher likelihood of disease as we get older.


163 Injection with Toxoplasma gondii protein affects neuron health and survival

Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that causes a long-term latent infection of neurons .
Using a custom MATLAB-based mapping program in combination with a mouse model that allows us to permanently mark neurons injected with parasite proteins , we found that Toxoplasma-injected neurons ( TINs ) are heterogeneously distributed in the brain , primarily localizing to the cortex followed by the striatum .
In addition , we determined that cortical TINs are commonly ( >50% ) excitatory neurons ( FoxP2+ ) and that striatal TINs are often ( >65% ) medium spiny neurons ( MSNs ) ( FoxP2+ ) .
By performing single neuron patch clamping on striatal TINs and neighboring uninfected MSNs , we discovered that TINs have highly aberrant electrophysiology .
As approximately 90% of TINs will die by 8 weeks post-infection , this abnormal physiology suggests that injection with Toxoplasma protein—either directly or indirectly—affects neuronal health and survival .
Collectively , these data offer the first insights into which neurons interact with Toxoplasma and how these interactions alter neuron physiology in vivo .

Toxoplasma gondii is a tiny parasite that can infect our neurons and stay hidden for a long time. Scientists used a special mapping program and mice to study how the parasite infects different types of neurons in our brain. They found that infected neurons can be found in different parts of the brain, but mostly in the cortex and striatum. They also discovered that different types of neurons are affected, with excitatory neurons in the cortex and medium spiny neurons in the striatum being most vulnerable to infection. Finally, they found out that infected neurons have abnormal electrical activity and are likely to die soon after infection. These findings give us a better understanding of how Toxoplasma affects our neurons and can help us develop better treatments.


164 Ultrafast endocytosis at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions

Synaptic vesicles can be released at extremely high rates , which places an extraordinary demand on the recycling machinery .
Previous ultrastructural studies of vesicle recycling were conducted in dissected preparations using an intense stimulation to maximize the probability of release .
Here , a single light stimulus was applied to motor neurons in intact Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes expressing channelrhodopsin , and the animals rapidly frozen .
We found that docked vesicles fuse along a broad active zone in response to a single stimulus , and are replenished with a time constant of about 2 s .
Endocytosis occurs within 50 ms adjacent to the dense projection and after 1 s adjacent to adherens junctions .
These studies suggest that synaptic vesicle endocytosis may occur on a millisecond time scale following a single physiological stimulus in the intact nervous system and is unlikely to conform to current models of endocytosis .

This study looked at how brain cells recycle tiny packages called synaptic vesicles. These vesicles are released really quickly when we use our brain, so the recycling process has to work super fast. Previous studies used a lot of force to make the vesicles release, but this study used a gentler light to stimulate the brain cells in worms. The researchers found that the recycling process starts just milliseconds after the stimulation and is much faster than previously thought. They also found that the process happens differently than what we currently understand about it.


165 Inhibition by small-molecule ligands of formation of amyloid fibrils of an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain

Overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains leads to systemic amyloidosis , a lethal disease characterized by the formation of amyloid fibrils in patients' tissues .
Excess light chains are in equilibrium between dimers and less stable monomers which can undergo irreversible aggregation to the amyloid state .
The dimers therefore must disassociate into monomers prior to forming amyloid fibrils .
Here we identify ligands that inhibit amyloid formation by stabilizing the Mcg light chain variable domain dimer and shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer .

When our bodies make too many immunoglobulin light chains, a deadly disease called systemic amyloidosis can form. This disease is characterized by clumps of protein (amyloid fibrils) that build up in the body's tissues. The excess light chains can exist in two forms - dimers and monomers - and it's the unstable monomers that lead to disease. However, we have discovered substances that can prevent this by stabilizing the dimers, which tips the balance in favor of the non-disease-causing form.


166 Plasmodium P36 determines host cell receptor usage during sporozoite invasion

Plasmodium sporozoites , the mosquito-transmitted forms of the malaria parasite , first infect the liver for an initial round of replication before the emergence of pathogenic blood stages .
Sporozoites represent attractive targets for antimalarial preventive strategies , yet the mechanisms of parasite entry into hepatocytes remain poorly understood .
Here we show that the two main species causing malaria in humans , Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax , rely on two distinct host cell surface proteins , CD81 and the Scavenger Receptor BI ( SR-BI ) , respectively , to infect hepatocytes .
By contrast , CD81 and SR-BI fulfil redundant functions during infection by the rodent parasite P . berghei .
Genetic analysis of sporozoite factors reveals the 6-cysteine domain protein P36 as a major parasite determinant of host cell receptor usage .
Our data provide molecular insights into the invasion pathways used by different malaria parasites to infect hepatocytes , and establish a functional link between a sporozoite putative ligand and host cell receptors .

Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitoes. The parasite has different forms that infect different parts of our body. Scientists are looking for ways to prevent malaria by targeting one of the early stages of the parasite's life cycle, when it infects the liver. However, we don't understand very well how the parasite enters liver cells. In this study, researchers discovered that the two main types of malaria that humans get use different proteins on the surface of liver cells to enter them. They also found a protein on the parasite's surface that is important for binding to these host cell proteins. These findings could help us design new ways to prevent malaria from spreading.


167 Homeodomain protein Otp affects developmental neuropeptide switching in oxytocin neurons associated with a long-term effect on social behavior

Proper response to stress and social stimuli depends on orchestrated development of hypothalamic neuronal circuits .
Here we address the effects of the developmental transcription factor orthopedia ( Otp ) on hypothalamic development and function .
We show that developmental mutations in the zebrafish paralogous gene otpa but not otpb affect both stress response and social preference .
These behavioral phenotypes were associated with developmental alterations in oxytocinergic ( OXT ) neurons .
Thus , otpa and otpb differentially regulate neuropeptide switching in a newly identified subset of OXT neurons that co-express the corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) .
Single-cell analysis revealed that these neurons project mostly to the hindbrain and spinal cord .
Ablation of this neuronal subset specifically reduced adult social preference without affecting stress behavior , thereby uncoupling the contribution of a specific OXT cluster to social behavior from the general otpa−/− deficits .
Our findings reveal a new role for Otp in controlling developmental neuropeptide balance in a discrete OXT circuit whose disrupted development affects social behavior .

This study looks at how the brain develops in response to stress and social situations. By studying zebrafish, the researchers found that a specific gene called "otpa" affects how the fish react to stress and social situations. This is because otpa influences certain brain cells that produce a hormone called oxytocin, which affects social behavior. When these brain cells are not working properly, fish are less likely to engage in social interaction. This research sheds light on how genes affect behavior and can help us better understand how we react to stressful and social situations.


168 The impact of measles immunization campaigns in India using a nationally representative sample of 27,000 child deaths

India comprises much of the persisting global childhood measles mortality .
India implemented a mass second-dose measles immunization campaign in 2010 .
We used interrupted time series and multilevel regression to quantify the campaign’s impact on measles mortality using the nationally representative Million Death Study ( including 27 , 000 child deaths in 1 . 3 million households surveyed from 2005 to 2013 ) .
1–59 month measles mortality rates fell more in the campaign states following launch ( 27% ) versus non-campaign states ( 11% ) .
Declines were steeper in girls than boys and were specific to measles deaths .
Measles mortality risk was lower for children living in a campaign district ( OR 0 . 6 , 99% CI 0 . 4–0 . 8 ) or born in 2009 or later ( OR 0 . 8 , 99% CI 0 . 7–0 . 9 ) .
The campaign averted up to 41 , 000–56 , 000 deaths during 2010–13 , or 39–57% of the expected deaths nationally .
Elimination of measles deaths in India is feasible .

Measles has been a serious problem for children in India. However, in 2010, the government started giving a second dose of the vaccine to children. To see how much this helped, researchers looked at data from a large study of households from 2005 to 2013. They found that measles deaths went down more in areas where the vaccine campaign happened compared to areas where it didn't happen. Girls saw a bigger decrease in deaths than boys, and the decrease was specific to measles deaths. Children who lived in areas where the campaign happened were less likely to die from measles. The study suggests that the campaign prevented tens of thousands of deaths, and it shows that it is possible to get rid of measles deaths in India.


169 The roles of online and offline replay in planning

Animals and humans replay neural patterns encoding trajectories through their environment , both whilst they solve decision-making tasks and during rest .
Both on-task and off-task replay are believed to contribute to flexible decision making , though how their relative contributions differ remains unclear .
We investigated this question by using magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) to study human subjects while they performed a decision-making task that was designed to reveal the decision algorithms employed .
We characterised subjects in terms of how flexibly each adjusted their choices to changes in temporal , spatial and reward structure .
The more flexible a subject , the more they replayed trajectories during task performance , and this replay was coupled with re-planning of the encoded trajectories .
The less flexible a subject , the more they replayed previously preferred trajectories during rest periods between task epochs .
The data suggest that online and offline replay both participate in planning but support distinct decision strategies .

This study looked at how both animals and humans replay patterns in their brains when they navigate their environment and make decisions. The researchers used a special brain imaging method to study how people solve problems and adjust their choices to changing situations. They found that people who were more flexible in their decision-making also replayed their decision-making patterns more often, especially while actively solving problems. On the other hand, people who were less flexible seemed to replay their preferred patterns during rest periods. Overall, the study suggests that replaying these patterns helps the brain plan and make decisions, but how much it contributes depends on the situation.


170 c-di-GMP heterogeneity is generated by the chemotaxis machinery to regulate flagellar motility

Individual cell heterogeneity is commonly observed within populations , although its molecular basis is largely unknown .
Previously , using FRET-based microscopy , we observed heterogeneity in cellular c-di-GMP levels .
In this study , we show that c-di-GMP heterogeneity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is promoted by a specific phosphodiesterase partitioned after cell division .
We found that subcellular localization and reduction of c-di-GMP levels by this phosphodiesterase is dependent on the histidine kinase component of the chemotaxis machinery , CheA , and its phosphorylation state .
Therefore , individual cell heterogeneity in c-di-GMP concentrations is regulated by the activity and the asymmetrical inheritance of the chemotaxis organelle after cell division .
c-di-GMP heterogeneity results in a diversity of motility behaviors .
The generation of diverse intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP by asymmetric partitioning is likely important to the success and survival of bacterial populations within the environment by allowing a variety of motility behaviors .

Basically, within groups of cells, we often see differences in how the individual cells behave and what molecules they have inside them. We previously found that some bacteria have differences in the amount of a particular molecule called c-di-GMP. This study showed that these differences are caused by a specific protein that breaks down c-di-GMP after a cell divides. The protein is affected by other parts of the cell that allow the bacteria to move around and find nutrients. Having these differences in c-di-GMP help the bacteria to survive in changing environments by allowing them to move in different ways.


171 Diversity and plasticity in Rab GTPase nucleotide release mechanism has consequences for Rab activation and inactivation

Ras superfamily GTPase activation and inactivation occur by canonical nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis mechanisms .
Despite conservation of active-site residues , the Ras-related Rab GTPase activation pathway differs from Ras and between different Rabs .
Analysis of DENND1-Rab35 , Rabex-Rab5 , TRAPP-Rab1 and DrrA-Rab1 suggests Rabs have the potential for activation by distinct GDP-release pathways .
Conserved active-site residues in the Rab switch II region stabilising the nucleotide-free form differentiate these pathways .
For DENND1-Rab35 and DrrA-Rab1 the Rab active-site glutamine , often mutated to create constitutively active forms , is involved in GEF mediated GDP-release .
By contrast , in Rab5 the switch II aspartate is required for Rabex mediated GDP-release .
Furthermore , Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants refractory to activation by DrrA can be activated by TRAPP , showing that a single Rab can be activated by more than one mechanistically distinct GDP-release pathway .
These findings highlight plasticity in the activation mechanisms of closely related Rab GTPases .

This study looked at different ways that proteins called Rabs can be turned on and off. Rabs are like switches that control certain cellular processes. The researchers found that although Rabs are similar to each other and to another protein called Ras, they have some differences in how they get turned on. They found that different Rabs can be activated by different pathways, which is important because it shows that there are several ways to control these processes in a cell. They also found that some mutations in Rabs can make them always turned on or always turned off. This research shows that there are many ways to control the activity of these important proteins in our cells.


172 Time-resolved multimodal analysis of Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain binding in signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases

While the affinities and specificities of SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions have been well characterized , spatio-temporal changes in phosphosite availability in response to signals , and their impact on recruitment of SH2-containing proteins in vivo , are not well understood .
To address this issue , we used three complementary experimental approaches to monitor phosphorylation and SH2 binding in human A431 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) :
1 ) phospho-specific mass spectrometry;
2 ) far-Western blotting; and
3 ) live cell single-molecule imaging of SH2 membrane recruitment .
Far-Western and MS analyses identified both well-established and previously undocumented EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and binding events , as well as dynamic changes in binding patterns over time .
In comparing SH2 binding site phosphorylation with SH2 domain membrane recruitment in living cells , we found in vivo binding to be much slower .
Delayed SH2 domain recruitment correlated with clustering of SH2 domain binding sites on the membrane , consistent with membrane retention via SH2 rebinding .

This study looked at how proteins interact with each other in response to a signal called epidermal growth factor. We used three different methods to see how specific parts of the proteins (called SH2 domains) attach to other parts (called phosphotyrosine sites) when cells are stimulated with epidermal growth factor. We found that this process is more complicated than we thought and changes over time. We also found that the proteins bind to each other much more slowly in living cells compared to in a laboratory setting. This delay might help the proteins stick to the cell membrane for longer periods of time.


173 Chromerid genomes reveal the evolutionary path from photosynthetic algae to obligate intracellular parasites

The eukaryotic phylum Apicomplexa encompasses thousands of obligate intracellular parasites of humans and animals with immense socio-economic and health impacts .
We sequenced nuclear genomes of Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis , free-living non-parasitic photosynthetic algae closely related to apicomplexans .
Proteins from key metabolic pathways and from the endomembrane trafficking systems associated with a free-living lifestyle have been progressively and non-randomly lost during adaptation to parasitism .
The free-living ancestor contained a broad repertoire of genes many of which were repurposed for parasitic processes , such as extracellular proteins , components of a motility apparatus , and DNA- and RNA-binding protein families .
Based on transcriptome analyses across 36 environmental conditions , Chromera orthologs of apicomplexan invasion-related motility genes were co-regulated with genes encoding the flagellar apparatus , supporting the functional contribution of flagella to the evolution of invasion machinery .
This study provides insights into how obligate parasites with diverse life strategies arose from a once free-living phototrophic marine alga .

Thousands of parasites that can infect humans and animals belong to a group called Apicomplexa. Scientists studied the genomes of two types of algae that are closely related to Apicomplexa, but do not cause disease. They found that many genes related to living independently, like being able to make food through photosynthesis or moving around, were lost when Apicomplexa evolved into parasites. The ancestors of Apicomplexa had many genes that were later used for parasitic activities, like invading host cells. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of structures used for movement, like flagella, played a role in the evolution of parasitic abilities. This helps us understand how parasites with different lifestyles evolved from a type of algae that could live on its own.


174 Low-noise encoding of active touch by layer 4 in the somatosensory cortex

Cortical spike trains often appear noisy , with the timing and number of spikes varying across repetitions of stimuli .
Spiking variability can arise from internal ( behavioral state , unreliable neurons , or chaotic dynamics in neural circuits ) and external ( uncontrolled behavior or sensory stimuli ) sources .
The amount of irreducible internal noise in spike trains , an important constraint on models of cortical networks , has been difficult to estimate , since behavior and brain state must be precisely controlled or tracked .
We recorded from excitatory barrel cortex neurons in layer 4 during active behavior , where mice control tactile input through learned whisker movements .
Touch was the dominant sensorimotor feature , with >70% spikes occurring in millisecond timescale epochs after touch onset .
The variance of touch responses was smaller than expected from Poisson processes , often reaching the theoretical minimum .
Layer 4 spike trains thus reflect the millisecond-timescale structure of tactile input with little noise .

The way our brain cells (called neurons) communicate with each other (through spiking) can sometimes be messy, with inconsistent timing and numbers of spikes. This can happen for many reasons - our own behavior, unreliable neurons, or even internal chaos. It's important for us to understand how much this "noise" is coming from the brain itself (rather than external factors) in order to build accurate models of brain networks. 
Scientists recently studied mice brains during touch-related tasks and found that the spiking patterns were highly structured and surprisingly consistent - with very little noise. This discovery gives us important insights into how our brain processes touch and could help us design better neural networks.


175 Transcription-coupled genetic instability marks acute lymphoblastic leukemia structural variation hotspots

Progression of malignancy to overt disease requires multiple genetic hits .
Activation-induced deaminase ( AID ) can drive lymphomagenesis by generating off-target DNA breaks at loci that harbor highly active enhancers and display convergent transcription .
The first active transcriptional profiles from acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patients acquired here reveal striking similarity at structural variation ( SV ) sites .
Specific transcriptional features , namely convergent transcription and Pol2 stalling , were detected at breakpoints .
The overlap was most prominent at SV with recognition motifs for the recombination activating genes ( RAG ) .
We present signal feature analysis to detect vulnerable regions and quantified from human cells how convergent transcription contributes to R-loop generation and RNA polymerase stalling .
Wide stalling regions were characterized by high DNAse hypersensitivity and unusually broad H3K4me3 signal .
Based on 1382 pre-B-ALL patients , the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion positive patients had over ten-fold elevation in RAG1 while high expression of AID marked pre-B-ALL lacking common cytogenetic changes .

Cancer is caused by multiple genetic changes, and a certain molecule called AID can further drive the development of cancer by breaking DNA in specific parts of our cells. Scientists have found that these breaks happen in areas with active genetic activity, called enhancers. They studied samples from patients with a type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia and found they all had similar genetic changes at certain sites. They also found that a certain type of genetic activity, called convergent transcription and RNA polymerase stalling, was most common at these cancer-causing DNA breaks. By studying human cells, they found that this type of genetic activity helps create certain structures in our DNA that are vulnerable to cancer-causing changes. They also found that these vulnerable sites are marked by certain chemical tags on the DNA, which may help detect cancer early on.


176 Rapid stimulus-driven modulation of slow ocular position drifts

The eyes are never still during maintained gaze fixation .
When microsaccades are not occurring , ocular position exhibits continuous slow changes , often referred to as drifts .
Unlike microsaccades , drifts remain to be viewed as largely random eye movements .
Here we found that ocular position drifts can , instead , be very systematically stimulus-driven , and with very short latencies .
We used highly precise eye tracking in three well trained macaque monkeys and found that even fleeting ( ~8 ms duration ) stimulus presentations can robustly trigger transient and stimulus-specific modulations of ocular position drifts , and with only approximately 60 ms latency .
Such drift responses are binocular , and they are most effectively elicited with large stimuli of low spatial frequency .
Intriguingly , the drift responses exhibit some image pattern selectivity , and they are not explained by convergence responses , pupil constrictions , head movements , or starting eye positions .
Ocular position drifts have very rapid access to exogenous visual information .

When we stare at something, our eyes are always moving, even if we don't notice it. These little movements are called microsaccades, and they happen all the time. But there are also slower movements, called drifts, that happen when we look at something for a long time. Scientists used very precise eye tracking to study these drifts in monkeys and found that they could be triggered by brief flashes of light. This means that our eyes can quickly respond to new visual information, even if it's just a very short flash. The scientists also found that these drifts are affected by the size and pattern of the image, and can't be explained by other movements like turning our heads or changing the size of our pupils.


177 Heritable capture of heterochromatin dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Heterochromatin exerts a heritable form of eukaryotic gene repression and contributes to chromosome segregation fidelity and genome stability .
However , to date there has been no quantitative evaluation of the stability of heterochromatic gene repression .
We designed a genetic strategy to capture transient losses of gene silencing in Saccharomyces as permanent , heritable changes in genotype and phenotype .
This approach revealed rare transcription within heterochromatin that occurred in approximately 1/1000 cell divisions .
In concordance with multiple lines of evidence suggesting these events were rare and transient , single-molecule RNA FISH showed that transcription was limited .
The ability to monitor fluctuations in heterochromatic repression uncovered previously unappreciated roles for Sir1 , a silencing establishment factor , in the maintenance and/or inheritance of silencing .
In addition , we identified the sirtuin Hst3 and its histone target as contributors to the stability of the silenced state .
These approaches revealed dynamics of a heterochromatin function that have been heretofore inaccessible .

Heterochromatin is a part of our genes that helps to keep them working properly and keeps our DNA stable. However, scientists have not been able to measure how well this works until now. We created a way to track how well genes stay silenced in yeast cells. We found that only about one in every thousand cell divisions has problems with gene silence. We also found new ways that genes are kept silent, and we identified proteins involved in this process. Our study gives us a better understanding of how our genes work and how they stay healthy.


178 Selectively driving cholinergic fibers optically in the thalamic reticular nucleus promotes sleep

Cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain and brainstem are thought to play important roles in rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep and arousal .
Using transgenic mice in which channelrhdopsin-2 is selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons , we show that optical stimulation of cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus ( TRN ) activates local GABAergic neurons to promote sleep and protect non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep .
It does not affect REM sleep .
Instead , direct activation of cholinergic input to the TRN shortens the time to sleep onset and generates spindle oscillations that correlate with NREM sleep .
It does so by evoking excitatory postsynaptic currents via α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inducing bursts of action potentials in local GABAergic neurons .
These findings stand in sharp contrast to previous reports of cholinergic activity driving arousal .
Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling sleep .

Scientists have learned that certain parts of the brain play important roles in controlling sleep. By studying mice with special genes, they discovered that shining a light on these brain parts can make it easier to fall asleep and improve the quality of deep sleep. This happens because the light triggers some brain cells to release a chemical that promotes relaxation. Surprisingly, this chemical doesn't affect dreams or the lighter stages of sleep. Instead, it helps the brain produce specific types of waves that are associated with restorative sleep. These findings challenge previous ideas about how the brain controls sleep and may lead to new treatments for sleep disorders.


179 Defining the role of pulmonary endothelial cell heterogeneity in the response to acute lung injury

Pulmonary endothelial cells ( ECs ) are an essential component of the gas exchange machinery of the lung alveolus .
Despite this , the extent and function of lung EC heterogeneity remains incompletely understood .
Using single-cell analytics , we identify multiple EC populations in the mouse lung , including macrovascular endothelium ( maEC ) , microvascular endothelium ( miECs ) , and a new population we have termed Car4-high ECs .
Car4-high ECs express a unique gene signature , and ligand-receptor analysis indicates they are primed to receive reparative signals from alveolar type I cells .
After acute lung injury , they are preferentially localized in regenerating regions of the alveolus .
Influenza infection reveals the emergence of a population of highly proliferative ECs that likely arise from multiple miEC populations and contribute to alveolar revascularization after injury .
These studies map EC heterogeneity in the adult lung and characterize the response of novel EC subpopulations required for tissue regeneration after acute lung injury .

Our lungs are responsible for exchanging gases in our body, a process that relies on cells called pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs). Despite their importance, we don't fully understand the different types of ECs in the lungs and how they function. Recently, using advanced technology, researchers discovered three types of ECs in mice lungs: macrovascular endothelium, microvascular endothelium, and a new type called Car4-high ECs. These Car4-high ECs have a unique gene signature and are able to receive signals to help repair damaged lung tissue. During acute lung injury, these cells are found in the areas that are regenerating. The researchers also found that during influenza infection, highly proliferative ECs are produced that help with revascularization after lung injury. By learning more about these different types of ECs, we can better understand how the lungs work and develop new treatments for lung diseases.


180 An internal thioester in a pathogen surface protein mediates covalent host binding

To cause disease and persist in a host , pathogenic and commensal microbes must adhere to tissues .
Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins , or adhesins .
To date , adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently .
Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a ‘chemical harpoon’ .
This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation .
Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria , including many clinically relevant pathogens .
Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions .
This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions .

To make you sick and stick around in your body, bacteria need to stick to your tissues. This sticking involves certain proteins on the bacteria's surface, which latch onto proteins on your cells. Until now, scientists thought these proteins only stuck to your cells without a strong chemical bond. But, we've discovered that a protein found in streptococcal bacteria can actually form a strong bond with a human protein called fibrinogen, using a chemical process like throwing a harpoon. This lets the bacteria stick to fibrin and also bind to human cells during infections. It turns out that many other bacteria have similar proteins that form these strong bonds. This discovery gives us new ways to fight bacterial infections and might even help us engineer bacteria to do beneficial things in our bodies.


181 A novel lineage of candidate pheromone receptors for sex communication in moths

Sex pheromone receptors ( PRs ) are key players in chemical communication between mating partners in insects .
In the highly diversified insect order Lepidoptera , male PRs tuned to female-emitted type I pheromones ( which make up the vast majority of pheromones identified ) form a dedicated subfamily of odorant receptors ( ORs ) .
Here , using a combination of heterologous expression and in vivo genome editing methods , we bring functional evidence that at least one moth PR does not belong to this subfamily but to a distantly related OR lineage .
This PR , identified in the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis , is highly expressed in male antennae and is specifically tuned to the major sex pheromone component emitted by females .
Together with a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of moth ORs , our functional data suggest two independent apparitions of PRs tuned to type I pheromones in Lepidoptera , opening up a new path for studying the evolution of moth pheromone communication .

Insects use scents called pheromones to communicate with each other, especially when they're looking for a mate. Scientists have been studying how these scents work in a group of insects called moths. They found that a special type of scent receptor, called a PR, helps male moths detect the pheromones that female moths give off. However, in one type of moth, scientists discovered a different kind of PR that works in an unexpected way. They used special techniques to show that this receptor is tuned specifically to the main female pheromone. This new finding helps us understand more about how moths communicate and how they evolved over time.


182 Identification of a lipid scrambling domain in ANO6/TMEM16F

Phospholipid scrambling ( PLS ) is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism involving the regulated bidirectional transport of phospholipids down their concentration gradient between membrane leaflets .
ANO6/TMEM16F has been shown to be essential for Ca2+-dependent PLS , but controversy surrounds whether ANO6 is a phospholipid scramblase or an ion channel like other ANO/TMEM16 family members .
Combining patch clamp recording with measurement of PLS , we show that ANO6 elicits robust Ca2+-dependent PLS coinciding with ionic currents that are explained by ionic leak during phospholipid translocation .
By analyzing ANO1-ANO6 chimeric proteins , we identify a domain in ANO6 necessary for PLS and sufficient to confer this function on ANO1 , which normally does not scramble .
Homology modeling shows that the scramblase domain forms an unusual hydrophilic cleft that faces the lipid bilayer and may function to facilitate translocation of phospholipid between membrane leaflets .
These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding PLS and how ANO6 functions in this process .

Scientists have discovered a process called phospholipid scrambling, which involves the regulated movement of a type of molecule called phospholipids within cells. ANO6 is a protein that plays an important role in one type of phospholipid scrambling that relies on calcium. However, it is unclear whether ANO6 works as a type of ion channel or as a scramblase, another type of protein that can move phospholipids. By conducting experiments and analyzing the structure of ANO6, researchers have confirmed that ANO6 does indeed function as a scramblase. They have identified a specific part of ANO6 that is necessary for this function and have shown that it can confer the scrambling ability onto similar proteins. This important discovery helps us understand better the complex processes that occur within cells.


183 Branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney is not impacted by nephron formation or integration

Branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud is integral to kidney development; establishing the collecting ducts of the adult organ and driving organ expansion via peripheral interactions with nephron progenitor cells .
A recent study suggested that termination of tip branching within the developing kidney involved stochastic exhaustion in response to nephron formation , with such a termination event representing a unifying developmental process evident in many organs .
To examine this possibility , we have profiled the impact of nephron formation and maturation on elaboration of the ureteric bud during mouse kidney development .
We find a distinct absence of random branch termination events within the kidney or evidence that nephrogenesis impacts the branching program or cell proliferation in either tip or progenitor cell niches .
Instead , organogenesis proceeds in a manner indifferent to the development of these structures .
Hence , stochastic cessation of branching is not a unifying developmental feature in all branching organs .

Scientists studied how kidneys develop and grow by examining the branching of a structure called the ureteric bud. They discovered that a theory about the end of branching in organs due to the creation of new cells in a process called nephrogenesis is not true for kidneys. The development of the kidney continues regardless of how many new nephron cells are being created. This means that kidneys grow in a unique way and don't follow a general pattern seen in other organs.


184 Protein flexibility is required for vesicle tethering at the Golgi

The Golgi is decorated with coiled-coil proteins that may extend long distances to help vesicles find their targets .
GCC185 is a trans Golgi-associated protein that captures vesicles inbound from late endosomes .
Although predicted to be relatively rigid and highly extended , we show that flexibility in a central region is required for GCC185’s ability to function in a vesicle tethering cycle .
Proximity ligation experiments show that that GCC185’s N-and C-termini are within <40 nm of each other on the Golgi .
In physiological buffers without fixatives , atomic force microscopy reveals that GCC185 is shorter than predicted , and its flexibility is due to a central bubble that represents local unwinding of specific sequences .
Moreover , 85% of the N-termini are splayed , and the splayed N-terminus can capture transport vesicles in vitro .
These unexpected features support a model in which GCC185 collapses onto the Golgi surface , perhaps by binding to Rab GTPases , to mediate vesicle tethering .

The Golgi is a structure in our cells that helps transport molecules to where they need to go. It uses special proteins called coiled-coil proteins to guide little containers called vesicles to their correct destination. One of these proteins, called GCC185, catches vesicles that are on their way to the Golgi from another part of the cell. Scientists used special techniques to look at GCC185 and found out it's more flexible than they thought. They also found out that parts of GCC185 that they thought were far apart are actually pretty close together. This flexibility and proximity help GCC185 do its job of catching vesicles and bringing them to the Golgi. These new discoveries will help scientists understand how cells work and how diseases can develop when things don't work the way they should.


185 Artistoo, a library to build, share, and explore simulations of cells and tissues in the web browser

The cellular Potts model ( CPM ) is a powerful in silico method for simulating biological processes at tissue scale .
Their inherently graphical nature makes CPMs very accessible in theory , but in practice , they are mostly implemented in specialised frameworks users need to master before they can run simulations .
We here present Artistoo ( Artificial Tissue Toolbox ) , a JavaScript library for building ‘explorable’ CPM simulations where viewers can change parameters interactively , exploring their effects in real time .
Simulations run directly in the web browser and do not require third-party software , plugins , or back-end servers .
The JavaScript implementation imposes no major performance loss compared to frameworks written in C++; Artistoo remains sufficiently fast for interactive , real-time simulations .
Artistoo provides an opportunity to unlock CPM models for a broader audience: interactive simulations can be shared via a URL in a zero-install setting .
We discuss applications in CPM research , science dissemination , open science , and education .

The cellular Potts model (CPM) is a tool that can be used to simulate biological processes at the level of tissues. It is often difficult for people to actually use this tool because it requires specialized knowledge and software. That's where Artistoo comes in - it's a JavaScript library that lets users interact with CPM simulations without needing to learn any complicated software. It's really fast and can be easily shared with others online. This tool has lots of different potential uses, from research to education.


186 Network structure of brain atrophy in de novo Parkinson's disease

We mapped the distribution of atrophy in Parkinson's disease ( PD ) using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and clinical data from 232 PD patients and 117 controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative .
Deformation-based morphometry and independent component analysis identified PD-specific atrophy in the midbrain , basal ganglia , basal forebrain , medial temporal lobe , and discrete cortical regions .
The degree of atrophy reflected clinical measures of disease severity .
The spatial pattern of atrophy demonstrated overlap with intrinsic networks present in healthy brain , as derived from functional MRI .
Moreover , the degree of atrophy in each brain region reflected its functional and anatomical proximity to a presumed disease epicenter in the substantia nigra , compatible with a trans-neuronal spread of the disease .
These results support a network-spread mechanism in PD .
Finally , the atrophy pattern in PD was also seen in healthy aging , where it also correlated with the loss of striatal dopaminergic innervation .

Our study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patient data to understand how Parkinson's disease affects the brain. We found that certain regions in the brain, like the midbrain and temporal lobe, are affected more in Parkinson's patients than in people without the disease. The severity of the disease also matched how much the brain had been affected. We also found that the same regions of the brain that were damaged in Parkinson's patients were also affected in healthy aging, suggesting that aging may be related to the development of the disease. Our findings suggest that Parkinson's disease may spread through a network in the brain.


187 Mechanism of environmentally driven conformational changes that modulate H-NS DNA-bridging activity

Bacteria frequently need to adapt to altered environmental conditions .
Adaptation requires changes in gene expression , often mediated by global regulators of transcription .
The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS is a key global regulator in Gram-negative bacteria and is believed to be a crucial player in bacterial chromatin organization via its DNA-bridging activity .
H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors ( osmolarity , pH , temperature ) and interaction partners .
Mechanistically , it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved .
Here , we show that a diverse spectrum of H-NS modulators alter the DNA-bridging activity of H-NS .
Changes in monovalent and divalent ion concentrations drive an abrupt switch between a bridging and non-bridging DNA-binding mode .
Similarly , synergistic and antagonistic co-regulators modulate the DNA-bridging efficiency .
Structural studies suggest a conserved mechanism: H-NS switches between a ‘closed’ and an ‘open’ , bridging competent , conformation driven by environmental cues and interaction partners .

Bacteria need to adapt to changes in their environment, which involves changes in gene expression. One important protein that controls this process is called H-NS. H-NS helps organize the DNA in bacterial cells, but it can be influenced by factors such as temperature and pH, which can change its activity. We studied how different molecules affect H-NS and found that changes in ions and other molecules can cause it to switch between different modes of binding to DNA. We also found that H-NS can switch between different shapes, which can be controlled by the environment and other proteins. This research helps us understand how bacteria adapt to changing conditions and could lead to new ways of controlling bacterial growth.


188 R-spondin signalling is essential for the maintenance and differentiation of mouse nephron progenitors

During kidney development , WNT/β-catenin signalling has to be tightly controlled to ensure proliferation and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells .
Here , we show in mice that the signalling molecules RSPO1 and RSPO3 act in a functionally redundant manner to permit WNT/β-catenin signalling and their genetic deletion leads to a rapid decline of nephron progenitors .
By contrast , tissue specific deletion in cap mesenchymal cells abolishes mesenchyme to epithelial transition ( MET ) that is linked to a loss of Bmp7 expression , absence of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and a concomitant failure to activate Lef1 , Fgf8 and Wnt4 , thus explaining the observed phenotype on a molecular level .
Surprisingly , the full knockout of LGR4/5/6 , the cognate receptors of R-spondins , only mildly affects progenitor numbers , but does not interfere with MET .
Taken together our data demonstrate key roles for R-spondins in permitting stem cell maintenance and differentiation and reveal Lgr-dependent and independent functions for these ligands during kidney formation .

Our study focused on how kidneys develop and found that two signaling molecules, RSPO1 and RSPO3, work together to allow for proper growth and development of kidney cells. Without these molecules, the number of kidney cells decreases rapidly. We also discovered that when specific cells in the kidney are deleted, the cells are unable to change from one type to another, which is necessary for proper development. We were surprised to find that the complete absence of the receptors for RSPO1 and RSPO3 only mildly affected the number of kidney cells, but did not impact their ability to change type. Our findings show that RSPO1 and RSPO3 are important for the maintenance and development of kidney cells and function in multiple ways during kidney formation.


189 Photoreceptor avascular privilege is shielded by soluble VEGF receptor-1

Optimal phototransduction requires separation of the avascular photoreceptor layer from the adjacent vascularized inner retina and choroid .
Breakdown of peri-photoreceptor vascular demarcation leads to retinal angiomatous proliferation or choroidal neovascularization , two variants of vascular invasion of the photoreceptor layer in age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized nations .
Here we show that sFLT-1 , an endogenous inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , is synthesized by photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , and is decreased in human AMD .
Suppression of sFLT-1 by antibodies , adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference , or Cre/lox-mediated gene ablation either in the photoreceptor layer or RPE frees VEGF-A and abolishes photoreceptor avascularity .
These findings help explain the vascular zoning of the retina , which is critical for vision , and advance two transgenic murine models of AMD with spontaneous vascular invasion early in life .

Our eyesight relies on the proper functioning of photoreceptor cells, which detect light signals and transmit them to the brain. To do this effectively, these cells need to be separated from the blood vessels that nourish other parts of the eye. When this separation breaks down, it can lead to two types of abnormal blood vessel growth that can cause irreversible blindness in a condition called age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We recently discovered that a natural inhibitor called sFLT-1, which stops blood vessels from growing, is made by photoreceptor cells and other eye cells. In people with AMD, there is less sFLT-1, allowing blood vessels to invade the photoreceptor zone. We found that blocking sFLT-1 using various methods caused the blood vessels to grow into the photoreceptor layer, which is a major problem for vision. These findings help us understand how our eyes are structured for good vision, and may help us develop new treatments for AMD.


190 A new class of cyclin dependent kinase in Chlamydomonas is required for coupling cell size to cell division

Proliferating cells actively control their size by mechanisms that are poorly understood .
The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii divides by multiple fission , wherein a ‘counting’ mechanism couples mother cell-size to cell division number allowing production of uniform-sized daughters .
We identified a sizer protein , CDKG1 , that acts through the retinoblastoma ( RB ) tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting .
Loss of CDKG1 leads to fewer mitotic divisions and large daughters , while mis-expression of CDKG1 causes supernumerous mitotic divisions and small daughters .
The concentration of nuclear-localized CDKG1 in pre-mitotic cells is set by mother cell size , and its progressive dilution and degradation with each round of cell division may provide a link between mother cell-size and mitotic division number .
Cell-size-dependent accumulation of limiting cell cycle regulators such as CDKG1 is a potentially general mechanism for size control .

Cells have a way of controlling their size, but scientists don't fully understand how. A type of green algae called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a special way of dividing that keeps its daughter cells the same size. Researchers discovered a protein called CDKG1 that helps with this process by controlling how many times the cell divides. When CDKG1 is too low, there are fewer divisions and the daughter cells are too big. When there's too much CDKG1, there are too many divisions and the daughter cells are too small. This protein is regulated by the size of the mother cell, and may help link cell size to how many times a cell divides. This mechanism could be a way that cells in general control their size.


191 Paraxial mesoderm organoids model development of human somites

During the development of the vertebrate embryo , segmented structures called somites are periodically formed from the presomitic mesoderm ( PSM ) and give rise to the vertebral column .
While somite formation has been studied in several animal models , it is less clear how well this process is conserved in humans .
Recent progress has made it possible to study aspects of human paraxial mesoderm ( PM ) development such as the human segmentation clock in vitro using human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) ; however , somite formation has not been observed in these monolayer cultures .
Here , we describe the generation of human PM organoids from hPSCs ( termed Somitoids ) , which recapitulate the molecular , morphological , and functional features of PM development , including formation of somite-like structures in vitro .
Using a quantitative image-based screen , we identify critical parameters such as initial cell number and signaling modulations that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures in our organoid system .
In addition , using single-cell RNA-sequencing and 3D imaging , we show that PM organoids both transcriptionally and morphologically resemble their in vivo counterparts and can be differentiated into somite derivatives .
Our organoid system is reproducible and scalable , allowing for the systematic and quantitative analysis of human spine development and disease in vitro .

Scientists have been studying how vertebrate embryos grow for years. They have found that small segments called somites form in the embryonic tissue, and these eventually become the backbone. Until recently, it was unclear how this worked in humans. However, scientists can now study this process using cells called human pluripotent stem cells. Unfortunately, these cells have not been able to form somites in laboratory settings—until now. Researchers have created something called "Somitoids," which can form these somite-like structures. By carefully controlling different parameters during their growth, scientists can study how the human spine develops and how diseases may affect it.


192 High performance communication by people with paralysis using an intracortical brain-computer interface

Brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs ) have the potential to restore communication for people with tetraplegia and anarthria by translating neural activity into control signals for assistive communication devices .
While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept ( Serruya et al . , 2002; Simeral et al . , 2011; Bacher et al . , 2015; Nuyujukian et al . , 2015; Aflalo et al . , 2015; Gilja et al . , 2015; Jarosiewicz et al . , 2015; Wolpaw et al . , 1998; Hwang et al . , 2012; Spüler et al . , 2012; Leuthardt et al . , 2004; Taylor et al . , 2002; Schalk et al . , 2008; Moran , 2010; Brunner et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2013; Townsend and Platsko , 2016; Vansteensel et al . , 2016; Nuyujukian et al . , 2016; Carmena et al . , 2003; Musallam et al . , 2004; Santhanam et al . , 2006; Hochberg et al . , 2006; Ganguly et al . , 2011; O’Doherty et al . , 2011; Gilja et al . , 2012 ) , the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech .
Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI ( iBCI ) for communication , which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis .
The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies ( Gilja et al . , 2015; Kao et al . , 2016; Gilja et al . , 2012 ) .
For all three participants , performance exceeded previous iBCIs ( Bacher et al . , 2015; Jarosiewicz et al . , 2015 ) as measured by typing rate ( by a factor of 1 . 4–4 . 2 ) and information throughput ( by a factor of 2 . 2–4 . 0 ) .
This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function .
Clinical Trial No: NCT00912041 DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18554 . 001

Scientists have been working on technology that can help people with tetraplegia and anarthria communicate by using brain signals. Even though there have been promising studies in the past, the technology has not been accurate enough to be widely used. But now, researchers have developed a new system that can translate brain signals into information with a higher accuracy rate. Three people who participated in a clinical trial using this new system were able to type faster and more accurately than with previous systems. This new technology has the potential to be a helpful tool for people with limited motor abilities to communicate effectively.


193 Pretectal neurons control hunting behaviour

For many species , hunting is an innate behaviour that is crucial for survival , yet the circuits that control predatory action sequences are poorly understood .
We used larval zebrafish to identify a population of pretectal neurons that control hunting .
By combining calcium imaging with a virtual hunting assay , we identified a discrete pretectal region that is selectively active when animals initiate hunting .
Targeted genetic labelling allowed us to examine the function and morphology of individual cells and identify two classes of pretectal neuron that project to ipsilateral optic tectum or the contralateral tegmentum .
Optogenetic stimulation of single neurons of either class was able to induce sustained hunting sequences , in the absence of prey .
Furthermore , laser ablation of these neurons impaired prey-catching and prevented induction of hunting by optogenetic stimulation of the anterior-ventral tectum .
We propose that this specific population of pretectal neurons functions as a command system to induce predatory behaviour .

Hunting is important for many animals, but we don't know much about how their brains control this behavior. Scientists studied baby zebrafish and found a group of brain cells that are active when they start hunting. These cells communicate with other parts of the brain to control hunting behavior. The scientists were able to make the fish start hunting even when there wasn't real prey by using light to activate these cells. When they removed these cells, the fish had trouble catching prey and didn't start hunting when the scientists wanted them to. These results suggest that these brain cells act like a "switch" for hunting behavior.


194 Active machine learning-driven experimentation to determine compound effects on protein patterns

High throughput screening determines the effects of many conditions on a given biological target .
Currently , to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions ( e . g . similarities among targets ) or separate screens .
Ideally , data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments .
We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects .
We now show that , with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control , this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments .
The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance .

Researchers have developed a new method for testing the effects of different chemicals on the way a cell functions. They used a machine learning algorithm and robotic technology to test 48 chemicals on 48 different parts of a cell. Normally, testing all of these combinations would take a long time and be expensive. However, the machine learning algorithm was able to accurately predict what would happen in the remaining experiments by learning from the ones it had already done. The researchers hope that this technology could lead to faster and cheaper ways of testing new drugs and treatments.


195 Stella modulates transcriptional and endogenous retrovirus programs during maternal-to-zygotic transition

The maternal-to-zygotic transition ( MZT ) marks the period when the embryonic genome is activated and acquires control of development .
Maternally inherited factors play a key role in this critical developmental process , which occurs at the 2-cell stage in mice .
We investigated the function of the maternally inherited factor Stella ( encoded by Dppa3 ) using single-cell/embryo approaches .
We show that loss of maternal Stella results in widespread transcriptional mis-regulation and a partial failure of MZT .
Strikingly , activation of endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs ) is significantly impaired in Stella maternal/zygotic knockout embryos , which in turn leads to a failure to upregulate chimeric transcripts .
Amongst ERVs , MuERV-L activation is particularly affected by the absence of Stella , and direct in vivo knockdown of MuERV-L impacts the developmental potential of the embryo .
We propose that Stella is involved in ensuring activation of ERVs , which themselves play a potentially key role during early development , either directly or through influencing embryonic gene expression .

The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a crucial stage in embryonic development when the baby's genes become in charge. This process relies on factors inherited from the mother, especially at the 2-cell stage in mice. Scientists studied one of these factors, called Stella, and found that its absence caused significant mis-regulation of gene activity and a partial failure of MZT. They also discovered that a type of genetic material called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) didn't activate properly without Stella, which had consequences on the embryo's ability to express certain genes. Specifically, the team found that a type of ERV called MuERV-L was especially affected when Stella was missing, and that interfering with its activity directly affected the embryo's developmental potential. This research indicates that Stella ensures the activation of ERVs, and that these retroviruses might have an important role in early development by influencing gene expression.


196 Reward signal in a recurrent circuit drives appetitive long-term memory formation

Dopamine signals reward in animal brains .
A single presentation of a sugar reward to Drosophila activates distinct subsets of dopamine neurons that independently induce short- and long-term olfactory memories ( STM and LTM , respectively ) .
In this study , we show that a recurrent reward circuit underlies the formation and consolidation of LTM .
This feedback circuit is composed of a single class of reward-signaling dopamine neurons ( PAM-α1 ) projecting to a restricted region of the mushroom body ( MB ) , and a specific MB output cell type , MBON-α1 , whose dendrites arborize that same MB compartment .
Both MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 neurons are required during the acquisition and consolidation of appetitive LTM .
MBON-α1 additionally mediates the retrieval of LTM , which is dependent on the dopamine receptor signaling in the MB α/β neurons .
Our results suggest that a reward signal transforms a nascent memory trace into a stable LTM using a feedback circuit at the cost of memory specificity .

In simpler terms, when animals receive a reward, like sugar, a part of their brain called the dopamine neurons are activated and form short- and long-term memories. The study found that a specific type of dopamine neuron, called PAM-α1, along with a brain cell called MBON-α1, are responsible for creating and strengthening long-term memories related to rewards. They work together in a feedback circuit to make sure the memory sticks, but it can come at the cost of making the memory less specific. This research helps us understand how our brains respond to rewards and how memories are formed.


197 Structural ordering of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein repeats by inhibitory antibody 3D11

Plasmodium sporozoites express circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) on their surface , an essential protein that contains central repeating motifs .
Antibodies targeting this region can neutralize infection , and the partial efficacy of RTS , S/AS01 – the leading malaria vaccine against P . falciparum ( Pf ) – has been associated with the humoral response against the repeats .
Although structural details of antibody recognition of PfCSP have recently emerged , the molecular basis of antibody-mediated inhibition of other Plasmodium species via CSP binding remains unclear .
Here , we analyze the structure and molecular interactions of potent monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) 3D11 binding to P . berghei CSP ( PbCSP ) using molecular dynamics simulations , X-ray crystallography , and cryoEM .
We reveal that mAb 3D11 can accommodate all subtle variances of the PbCSP repeating motifs , and , upon binding , induces structural ordering of PbCSP through homotypic interactions .
Together , our findings uncover common mechanisms of antibody evolution in mammals against the CSP repeats of Plasmodium sporozoites .

Scientists have discovered an essential protein called circumsporozoite protein (CSP) that is found on the surface of Plasmodium sporozoites, a type of malaria parasite. This protein contains repeating patterns that can be targeted by antibodies to neutralize the infection. A leading malaria vaccine has been developed based on this protein, but its effectiveness is not yet fully understood. In this study, researchers used molecular simulations and imaging techniques to study how a potent antibody called 3D11 binds to a different type of Plasmodium species. They found that this antibody can adapt to different variations of the repeating patterns and change the structure of the protein it binds to. These findings provide new insights into how antibodies are developed against malaria and could potentially lead to better treatments or vaccines in the future.


198 mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status

While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 , it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection influence the immune defense they elicit , and whether they protect against variants .
Focusing on the T cell response , we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses , using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells .
Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral , B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 351 variant strains , both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes .
In infection-naïve individuals , the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells , while in convalescents the second dose changed neither .
Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees , with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx .
These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants , confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose , and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts .

Scientists have been studying how well mRNA vaccines work against COVID-19, and whether booster doses and prior infections affect how well the immune system can defend against the virus. They specifically looked at a type of immune cell called a T cell. In their study, they analyzed T cells in people who hadn't had COVID-19 before, as well as those who had already recovered. They found that the second vaccine dose boosted T cell production in people who hadn't been infected before, but not in those who had already recovered. They also found that T cells from people who had recovered and received the vaccine had different features that might make them better at fighting the virus in the long term. Importantly, they found that the T cells produced by the vaccine are able to fight against new strains of the virus, which is good news for everyone.


199 Different promoter affinities account for specificity in MYC-dependent gene regulation

Enhanced expression of the MYC transcription factor is observed in the majority of tumors .
Two seemingly conflicting models have been proposed for its function: one proposes that MYC enhances expression of all genes , while the other model suggests gene-specific regulation .
Here , we have explored the hypothesis that specific gene expression profiles arise since promoters differ in affinity for MYC and high-affinity promoters are fully occupied by physiological levels of MYC .
We determined cellular MYC levels and used RNA- and ChIP-sequencing to correlate promoter occupancy with gene expression at different concentrations of MYC .
Mathematical modeling showed that binding affinities for interactions of MYC with DNA and with core promoter-bound factors , such as WDR5 , are sufficient to explain promoter occupancies observed in vivo .
Importantly , promoter affinity stratifies different biological processes that are regulated by MYC , explaining why tumor-specific MYC levels induce specific gene expression programs and alter defined biological properties of cells .

Many tumors have a lot of a protein called MYC in them. People have suggested two different ideas for what MYC does: one that says MYC controls all genes, and another that says MYC only controls certain genes. We tested the second idea and found that MYC likes some promoters more than others, which means it only controls some genes. We used a mix of experiments and calculations to show how MYC interacts with DNA and other molecules to control these genes. This helps explain why lots of MYC is bad for you- it changes how your cells work by only controlling specific parts of them.


200 Previously undetected super-spreading of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed by deep sequencing

Tuberculosis disproportionately affects the Canadian Inuit .
To address this , it is imperative we understand transmission dynamics in this population .
We investigate whether ‘deep’ sequencing can provide additional resolution compared to standard sequencing , using a well-characterized outbreak from the Arctic ( 2011–2012 , 50 cases ) .
Samples were sequenced to ~500–1000x and reads were aligned to a novel local reference genome generated with PacBio SMRT sequencing .
Consensus and heterogeneous variants were identified and compared across genomes .
In contrast with previous genomic analyses using ~50x depth , deep sequencing allowed us to identify a novel super-spreader who likely transmitted to up to 17 other cases during the outbreak ( 35% of the remaining cases that year ) .
It is increasingly evident that within-host diversity should be incorporated into transmission analyses; deep sequencing may facilitate more accurate detection of super-spreaders and transmission clusters .
This has implications not only for TB , but all genomic studies of transmission - regardless of pathogen .

Tuberculosis is a disease that affects the Canadian Inuit more than any other group. In order to understand how the disease is transmitted within this population, we conducted a study using a new type of sequencing that allows us to better understand the genetic makeup of the disease. This type of sequencing, called "deep" sequencing, allowed us to identify a particular person who spread the disease to many others during an outbreak in 2011-2012. This finding shows that deep sequencing can help us identify people who might spread the disease to others more easily. This information can help us prevent the spread of tuberculosis not only among the Inuit, but also for other diseases as well.


201 Regulation of life span by the gut microbiota in the short-lived African turquoise killifish

Gut bacteria occupy the interface between the organism and the external environment , contributing to homeostasis and disease .
Yet , the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is largely unexplored .
Here , using the African turquoise killifish ( Nothobranchius furzeri ) , a naturally short-lived vertebrate , we show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating vertebrate life span .
Recolonizing the gut of middle-age individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span extension and delayed behavioral decline .
This intervention prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community , characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera Exiguobacterium , Planococcus , Propionigenium and Psychrobacter .
Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial systemic effects that lead to life span extension in a vertebrate model .

The bacteria in our gut are important for keeping us healthy, but we don't know much about how they affect aging. Scientists studied a fish that has a short lifespan and found that young bacteria can help older fish live longer. The older fish's gut had fewer types of bacteria, but adding young bacteria made it more like a young fish's gut. This helped the older fish stay healthier for longer. This study shows that having a diverse and healthy gut microbiome, with bacteria like Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium, and Psychrobacter, can help us live longer and healthier lives.


202 A label-free approach to detect ligand binding to cell surface proteins in real time

Electrophysiological recordings allow for monitoring the operation of proteins with high temporal resolution down to the single molecule level .
This technique has been exploited to track either ion flow arising from channel opening or the synchronized movement of charged residues and/or ions within the membrane electric field .
Here , we describe a novel type of current by using the serotonin transporter ( SERT ) as a model .
We examined transient currents elicited on rapid application of specific SERT inhibitors .
Our analysis shows that these currents originate from ligand binding and not from a long-range conformational change .
The Gouy-Chapman model predicts that adsorption of charged ligands to surface proteins must produce displacement currents and related apparent changes in membrane capacitance .
Here we verified these predictions with SERT .
Our observations demonstrate that ligand binding to a protein can be monitored in real time and in a label-free manner by recording the membrane capacitance .

Scientists can use a technique called electrophysiological recordings to monitor the activity of proteins at the tiniest level. This helps them see how molecules move and how charges flow within a cell's membrane. In a recent study, researchers used this technique to examine a protein called the serotonin transporter. They found that when certain inhibitors were applied, they caused changes in the protein's electrical current that were related to the binding of the inhibitor, rather than changes in its shape. This discovery supports a theory about how charged molecules interact with proteins, and shows that it's possible to track these interactions in real-time without using any special dyes or markers.


203 Inhibitory control of correlated intrinsic variability in cortical networks

Cortical networks exhibit intrinsic dynamics that drive coordinated , large-scale fluctuations across neuronal populations and create noise correlations that impact sensory coding .
To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics , we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different rodent species , sensory modalities , and behavioral states .
The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the diverse activity patterns in our recordings .
Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition .
Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations .
Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations .

This article explores how our brains work and how they process information from our senses. Researchers studied the activity of groups of neurons in different animals and observed that they have natural fluctuations that create noise. They used computer models to understand this phenomenon and found that the strength of a certain inhibiting neuron was what caused differences in the amount of noise. When this inhibiting neuron was more active, the brain was less noisy and more precise. This study helps us understand how our brains work and how distractions and other external factors can impact our ability to process information.


204 Genomics of 1 million parent lifespans implicates novel pathways and common diseases and distinguishes survival chances

We use a genome-wide association of 1 million parental lifespans of genotyped subjects and data on mortality risk factors to validate previously unreplicated findings near CDKN2B-AS1 , ATXN2/BRAP , FURIN/FES , ZW10 , PSORS1C3 , and 13q21 . 31 , and identify and replicate novel findings near ABO , ZC3HC1 , and IGF2R .
We also validate previous findings near 5q33 . 3/EBF1 and FOXO3 , whilst finding contradictory evidence at other loci .
Gene set and cell-specific analyses show that expression in foetal brain cells and adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is enriched for lifespan variation , as are gene pathways involving lipid proteins and homeostasis , vesicle-mediated transport , and synaptic function .
Individual genetic variants that increase dementia , cardiovascular disease , and lung cancer – but not other cancers – explain the most variance .
Resulting polygenic scores show a mean lifespan difference of around five years of life across the deciles .
Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review .
The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed ( see decision letter ) .

In this study, scientists looked at the genetic makeup of over a million people’s parents to see if there were any genes that are linked to how long someone lives. They found some of the same genes that were previously discovered, but they also found some new ones. They found that genes that affect the brain, the way cells transport things, and the body’s natural balance all play a role in how long someone lives. They also found that certain genetic variants increased the risk for dementia, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer - but not other cancers. Overall, the study found that some genetic differences can affect how long someone lives by about five years, on average.


205 Identification of novel, clinically correlated autoantigens in the monogenic autoimmune syndrome APS1 by proteome-wide PhIP-Seq

The identification of autoantigens remains a critical challenge for understanding and treating autoimmune diseases .
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS1 ) , a rare monogenic form of autoimmunity , presents as widespread autoimmunity with T and B cell responses to multiple organs .
Importantly , autoantibody discovery in APS1 can illuminate fundamental disease pathogenesis , and many of the antigens found in APS1 extend to more common autoimmune diseases .
Here , we performed proteome-wide programmable phage-display ( PhIP-Seq ) on sera from a cohort of people with APS1 and discovered multiple common antibody targets .
These novel APS1 autoantigens exhibit tissue-restricted expression , including expression in enteroendocrine cells , pineal gland , and dental enamel .
Using detailed clinical phenotyping , we find novel associations between autoantibodies and organ-restricted autoimmunity , including a link between anti-KHDC3L autoantibodies and premature ovarian insufficiency , and between anti-RFX6 autoantibodies and diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction .
Our study highlights the utility of PhIP-Seq for extensively interrogating antigenic repertoires in human autoimmunity and the importance of antigen discovery for improved understanding of disease mechanisms .

Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the body. Researchers are working to identify which proteins (called autoantigens) are triggering these attacks. One rare and severe autoimmune condition, called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1), involves the immune system attacking multiple organs. By studying people with APS1, researchers have discovered new autoantigens that are linked to specific organs. They found that autoantibodies targeting these proteins are associated with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as premature ovarian insufficiency and intestinal dysfunction. These findings could help doctors better diagnose and treat autoimmune diseases.


206 Ribosomal mutations promote the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a multidrug environment

Antibiotic resistance arising via chromosomal mutations is typically specific to a particular antibiotic or class of antibiotics .
We have identified mutations in genes encoding ribosomal components in Mycobacterium smegmatis that confer resistance to several structurally and mechanistically unrelated classes of antibiotics and enhance survival following heat shock and membrane stress .
These mutations affect ribosome assembly and cause large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic changes , including the downregulation of the catalase KatG , an activating enzyme required for isoniazid sensitivity , and upregulation of WhiB7 , a transcription factor involved in innate antibiotic resistance .
Importantly , while these ribosomal mutations have a fitness cost in antibiotic-free medium , in a multidrug environment they promote the evolution of high-level , target-based resistance .
Further , suppressor mutations can then be easily acquired to restore wild-type growth .
Thus , ribosomal mutations can serve as stepping-stones in an evolutionary path leading to the emergence of high-level , multidrug resistance .

We've discovered that certain changes in the genetic material of a type of bacteria called Mycobacterium smegmatis can make them resistant to many different types of antibiotics, even ones that work in very different ways. These changes also help the bacteria survive during changes in temperature and stress in their environment. These changes have a cost for the bacteria when they are not exposed to antibiotics, but in environments with multiple antibiotics, they become more resistant over time. The bacteria can also easily change back to their original form if they no longer need to be resistant. This shows us how antibiotic resistance can develop and get worse over time.


207 Quantification of microenvironmental metabolites in murine cancers reveals determinants of tumor nutrient availability

Cancer cell metabolism is heavily influenced by microenvironmental factors , including nutrient availability .
Therefore , knowledge of microenvironmental nutrient levels is essential to understand tumor metabolism .
To measure the extracellular nutrient levels available to tumors , we utilized quantitative metabolomics methods to measure the absolute concentrations of >118 metabolites in plasma and tumor interstitial fluid , the extracellular fluid that perfuses tumors .
Comparison of nutrient levels in tumor interstitial fluid and plasma revealed that the nutrients available to tumors differ from those present in circulation .
Further , by comparing interstitial fluid nutrient levels between autochthonous and transplant models of murine pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma , we found that tumor type , anatomical location and animal diet affect local nutrient availability .
These data provide a comprehensive characterization of the nutrients present in the tumor microenvironment of widely used models of lung and pancreatic cancer and identify factors that influence metabolite levels in tumors .

Scientists have found that cancer cells are affected by their surroundings and the nutrients available to them. They used a method called quantitative metabolomics to measure the amount of more than 118 nutrients in the fluid around tumors. They found that the nutrients available to tumors are different from those present in the blood. Furthermore, they discovered that the type of tumor, where it is in the body, and what the animal eats all affect the amount of nutrients available to the tumor. This information provides a better understanding of how tumors work and how they can be treated.


208 Future life expectancy in Europe taking into account the impact of smoking, obesity, and alcohol

Introduction: In Europe , women can expect to live on average 82 years and men 75 years .
Forecasting how life expectancy will develop in the future is essential for society .
Most forecasts rely on a mechanical extrapolation of past mortality trends , which leads to unreliable outcomes because of temporal fluctuations in the past trends due to lifestyle ‘epidemics’ .
Methods: We project life expectancy for 18 European countries by taking into account the impact of smoking , obesity , and alcohol on mortality , and the mortality experiences of forerunner populations .
Results: We project that life expectancy in these 18 countries will increase from , on average , 83 . 4 years for women and 78 . 3 years for men in 2014 to 92 . 8 years for women and 90 . 5 years for men in 2065 .
Compared to others ( Lee–Carter , Eurostat , United Nations ) , we project higher future life expectancy values and more realistic differences between countries and sexes .
Conclusions: Our results imply longer individual lifespans , and more elderly in society .
Funding: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research ( NWO ) ( grant no . 452-13-001 ) .

In Europe, women typically live to age 82 and men to age 75. It's important to know how long people are expected to live in the future, but past predictions have been unreliable because they only look at past trends in mortality rates. Our study took into account the effects of smoking, obesity, and alcohol on mortality, as well as data from populations that lived longer in the past. We predict that by 2065, people in 18 European countries will live even longer - on average, women will live to be almost 93 and men will live to be over 90! This means there will be more elderly people in society. Our study was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.


209 Local emergence in Amazonia of Plasmodium falciparum k13 C580Y mutants associated with in vitro artemisinin resistance

Antimalarial drug resistance has historically arisen through convergent de novo mutations in Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations in Southeast Asia and South America .
For the past decade in Southeast Asia , artemisinins , the core component of first-line antimalarial therapies , have experienced delayed parasite clearance associated with several pfk13 mutations , primarily C580Y .
We report that mutant pfk13 has emerged independently in Guyana , with genome analysis indicating an evolutionary origin distinct from Southeast Asia .
Pfk13 C580Y parasites were observed in 1 . 6% ( 14/854 ) of samples collected in Guyana in 2016–2017 .
Introducing pfk13 C580Y or R539T mutations by gene editing into local parasites conferred high levels of in vitro artemisinin resistance .
In vitro growth competition assays revealed a fitness cost associated with these pfk13 variants , potentially explaining why these resistance alleles have not increased in frequency more quickly in South America .
These data place local malaria control efforts at risk in the Guiana Shield .

Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum. There are drugs, called antimalarials, that can be used to treat it. However, the parasite can sometimes become resistant to these drugs, making them less effective. This has happened in Southeast Asia and South America before. In Southeast Asia, a mutation called pfk13 has caused delayed parasite clearance, and this mutation has now been found in Guyana as well. The mutant parasites were found in 1.6% of samples, and introducing this mutation into other parasites made them resistant to an important antimalarial drug called artemisinin. However, there seems to be a cost for the parasite associated with this mutation, which means it is not spreading as quickly in South America. These findings suggest that malaria control efforts in Guyana need to be carefully monitored to prevent the spread of drug-resistant parasites.


210 TUBB4A mutations result in both glial and neuronal degeneration in an H-ABC leukodystrophy mouse model

Mutations in TUBB4A result in a spectrum of leukodystrophy including Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum ( H-ABC ) , a rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy , often associated with a recurring variant p . Asp249Asn ( D249N ) .
We have developed a novel knock-in mouse model harboring heterozygous ( Tubb4aD249N/+ ) and the homozygous ( Tubb4aD249N/D249N ) mutation that recapitulate the progressive motor dysfunction with tremor , dystonia and ataxia seen in H-ABC .
Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice have myelination deficits along with dramatic decrease in mature oligodendrocytes and their progenitor cells .
Additionally , a significant loss occurs in the cerebellar granular neurons and striatal neurons in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice .
In vitro studies show decreased survival and dysfunction in microtubule dynamics in neurons from Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice .
Thus Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice demonstrate the complex cellular physiology of H-ABC , likely due to independent effects on oligodendrocytes , striatal neurons , and cerebellar granule cells in the context of altered microtubule dynamics , with profound neurodevelopmental deficits .

This study looked at a rare genetic disorder called Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H-ABC). The researchers created a special mouse model with mutations that cause this disorder to better understand the disease. The mice showed motor problems like tremors and trouble with movement, as well as changes in the brain that are similar to what happens in humans with H-ABC. The researchers found that the mutations affect different types of brain cells and can cause problems with the way cells communicate with each other. Overall, this study helps us understand more about H-ABC and how it affects the brain.


211 Glucose inhibits cardiac muscle maturation through nucleotide biosynthesis

The heart switches its energy substrate from glucose to fatty acids at birth , and maternal hyperglycemia is associated with congenital heart disease .
However , little is known about how blood glucose impacts heart formation .
Using a chemically defined human pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation system , we found that high glucose inhibits the maturation of cardiomyocytes at genetic , structural , metabolic , electrophysiological , and biomechanical levels by promoting nucleotide biosynthesis through the pentose phosphate pathway .
Blood glucose level in embryos is stable in utero during normal pregnancy , but glucose uptake by fetal cardiac tissue is drastically reduced in late gestational stages .
In a murine model of diabetic pregnancy , fetal hearts showed cardiomyopathy with increased mitotic activity and decreased maturity .
These data suggest that high glucose suppresses cardiac maturation , providing a possible mechanistic basis for congenital heart disease in diabetic pregnancy .

When babies are born, their hearts start using fatty acids instead of glucose for energy. Unfortunately, pregnant women with high blood sugar may be more likely to have babies born with heart problems. Scientists are still trying to figure out how high blood sugar affects heart development. They used human stem cells to study this and found that high blood sugar stops the heart muscle cells from maturing properly. This could be because sugar helps to make more DNA and other cell building blocks, rather than letting the cells focus on growing and getting stronger. In mice, high blood sugar during pregnancy also led to immature and weak hearts in the babies. This work helps us understand why heart problems can happen in babies born to moms with high blood sugar.


212 GLO-Roots: an imaging platform enabling multidimensional characterization of soil-grown root systems

Root systems develop different root types that individually sense cues from their local environment and integrate this information with systemic signals .
This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates , direction , and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network .
Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability .
To bridge this divide , we developed an integrated-imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots ( GLO-Roots ) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown , light-shielded roots .
We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties , gene expression , and root system architecture traits .
We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes .

Root systems have different types of roots that sense their local environment and communicate with each other. This helps roots adjust how they grow and what they do to adapt to their surroundings. Scientists study this process using imaging techniques, but current methods have limitations. To overcome these limitations, scientists have created a new imaging system called GLO-Roots. This system allows researchers to see how roots respond to their environment and study how they work together. Using this system, researchers hope to better understand how roots adapt to different conditions and find new ways to help plants grow stronger and healthier.


213 Set1/COMPASS and Mediator are repurposed to promote epigenetic transcriptional memory

In yeast and humans , previous experiences can lead to epigenetic transcriptional memory: repressed genes that exhibit mitotically heritable changes in chromatin structure and promoter recruitment of poised RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex ( RNAPII PIC ) , which enhances future reactivation .
Here , we show that INO1 memory in yeast is initiated by binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor to the cis-acting Memory Recruitment Sequence , targeting INO1 to the nuclear periphery .
Memory requires a remodeled form of the Set1/COMPASS methyltransferase lacking Spp1 , which dimethylates histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me2 ) .
H3K4me2 recruits the SET3C complex , which plays an essential role in maintaining this mark .
Finally , while active INO1 is associated with Cdk8- Mediator , during memory , Cdk8+ Mediator recruits poised RNAPII PIC lacking the Kin28 CTD kinase .
Aspects of this mechanism are generalizable to yeast and conserved in human cells .
Thus , COMPASS and Mediator are repurposed to promote epigenetic transcriptional poising by a highly conserved mechanism .

Our bodies have a genetic code that determines our traits, but environmental factors can also influence how our genes are expressed. In yeast and humans, past experiences can leave a lasting mark on our genetic material, called epigenetic transcriptional memory. This means certain genes can be turned off or suppressed, even after the initial environmental factor is gone. In this study, researchers found that a specific protein in yeast binds to a part of the genetic code, which helps target the gene to the outside of the nucleus. This memory requires certain chemicals and proteins to maintain the suppression of the gene, and other proteins to be recruited for future re-activation. This process is also found in human cells. Ultimately, this research helps us understand how certain genes can be turned off and on depending on our environment.


214 Intramuscular Neurotrophin-3 normalizes low threshold spinal reflexes, reduces spasms and improves mobility after bilateral corticospinal tract injury in rats

Brain and spinal injury reduce mobility and often impair sensorimotor processing in the spinal cord leading to spasticity .
Here , we establish that complete transection of corticospinal pathways in the pyramids impairs locomotion and leads to increased spasms and excessive mono- and polysynaptic low threshold spinal reflexes in rats .
Treatment of affected forelimb muscles with an adeno-associated viral vector ( AAV ) encoding human Neurotrophin-3 at a clinically-feasible time-point after injury reduced spasticity .
Neurotrophin-3 normalized the short latency Hoffmann reflex to a treated hand muscle as well as low threshold polysynaptic spinal reflexes involving afferents from other treated muscles .
Neurotrophin-3 also enhanced locomotor recovery .
Furthermore , the balance of inhibitory and excitatory boutons in the spinal cord and the level of an ion co-transporter in motor neuron membranes required for normal reflexes were normalized .
Our findings pave the way for Neurotrophin-3 as a therapy that treats the underlying causes of spasticity and not only its symptoms .

When someone has a brain or spinal injury, they can have trouble moving and may feel stiffness. Researchers studied rats with this problem and found that treating their affected muscles with a special virus that carries a protein called Neurotrophin-3 helped reduce stiffness and improve movement. The virus also helped the rats' nerves work better. The researchers think this treatment could help people with similar injuries, and not just mask their symptoms.


215 NOVA-dependent regulation of cryptic NMD exons controls synaptic protein levels after seizure

The neuronal RNA binding protein NOVA regulates splicing , shuttles to the cytoplasm , and co-localizes with target transcripts in dendrites , suggesting links between splicing and local translation .
Here we identified >200 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in abundance , but , surprisingly , HITS-CLIP revealed NOVA binds these RNAs in introns rather than 3′ UTRs .
This led us to discover NOVA-regulated splicing of cryptic exons within these introns .
These exons triggered nonsense mediated decay ( NMD ) , as UPF1 and protein synthesis were required for NOVA's effect on RNA levels .
Their regulation was dynamic and physiologically relevant .
The NMD exons were regulated by seizures , which also induced changes in Nova subcellular localization and mediated large changes in synaptic proteins , including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy .
Moreover , Nova haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy .
The data reveal a hidden means of dynamic RNA regulation linking electrical activity to splicing and protein output , and of mediating homeostatic excitation/inhibition balance in neurons .

This study looked at a protein in the brain called NOVA, which helps to control how genes are used to make proteins. We found that NOVA can change the way that certain genes are "spliced," which affects how much protein is made. Surprisingly, we found that NOVA is binding to these genes in parts of the gene called "introns," instead of where we expected. We also found that these changes in gene splicing are important for keeping the brain balanced and preventing seizures. When NOVA isn't working properly, mice can develop epilepsy. This discovery helps us understand how the brain regulates itself and could lead to better treatments for neurological disorders.


216 A single pair of neurons links sleep to memory consolidation in Drosophila melanogaster

Sleep promotes memory consolidation in humans and many other species , but the physiological and anatomical relationships between sleep and memory remain unclear .
Here , we show the dorsal paired medial ( DPM ) neurons , which are required for memory consolidation in Drosophila , are sleep-promoting inhibitory neurons .
DPMs increase sleep via release of GABA onto wake-promoting mushroom body ( MB ) α'/β' neurons .
Functional imaging demonstrates that DPM activation evokes robust increases in chloride in MB neurons , but is unable to cause detectable increases in calcium or cAMP .
Downregulation of α'/β' GABAA and GABABR3 receptors results in sleep loss , suggesting these receptors are the sleep-relevant targets of DPM-mediated inhibition .
Regulation of sleep by neurons necessary for consolidation suggests that these brain processes may be functionally interrelated via their shared anatomy .
These findings have important implications for the mechanistic relationship between sleep and memory consolidation , arguing for a significant role of inhibitory neurotransmission in regulating these processes .

When we sleep, our memories become stronger - that's true for us humans and many other animals too. But how exactly sleep helps consolidate memories is still a mystery. Scientists have discovered that in fruit flies, some neurons that are important for memory are also involved in promoting sleep. These neurons release a chemical called GABA that puts other neurons to sleep. By studying these neurons, the scientists found that they cause an increase in a certain chemical, chloride, in the neurons that help us stay awake. When those GABA receptors are blocked, the flies have trouble sleeping. This discovery suggests that the relationship between sleep and memory might be closer than we thought, and that inhibitory chemicals may play a big role in making sure we remember what we need to.


217 Consistent global structures of complex RNA states through multidimensional chemical mapping

Accelerating discoveries of non-coding RNA ( ncRNA ) in myriad biological processes pose major challenges to structural and functional analysis .
Despite progress in secondary structure modeling , high-throughput methods have generally failed to determine ncRNA tertiary structures , even at the 1-nm resolution that enables visualization of how helices and functional motifs are positioned in three dimensions .
We report that integrating a new method called MOHCA-seq ( Multiplexed •OH Cleavage Analysis with paired-end sequencing ) with mutate-and-map secondary structure inference guides Rosetta 3D modeling to consistent 1-nm accuracy for intricately folded ncRNAs with lengths up to 188 nucleotides , including a blind RNA-puzzle challenge , the lariat-capping ribozyme .
This multidimensional chemical mapping ( MCM ) pipeline resolves unexpected tertiary proximities for cyclic-di-GMP , glycine , and adenosylcobalamin riboswitch aptamers without their ligands and a loose structure for the recently discovered human HoxA9D internal ribosome entry site regulon .
MCM offers a sequencing-based route to uncovering ncRNA 3D structure , applicable to functionally important but potentially heterogeneous states .

Scientists are constantly discovering new types of RNA that play important roles in the way our bodies function. However, studying these "non-coding RNA" molecules and understanding their complex structures remains a challenge. Traditionally, methods to analyze RNA structure have been limited and unable to provide a complete picture. But now, researchers have developed a new approach called MOHCA-seq that combines multiple techniques to build a 3D model of RNA molecules with unprecedented accuracy. This method has been successful even with highly complex RNA structures, including one that stumped scientists for years. Understanding the 3D structure of RNA molecules is critical to understanding how they work and developing new treatments for diseases.


218 AMPK acts as a molecular trigger to coordinate glutamatergic signals and adaptive behaviours during acute starvation

The stress associated with starvation is accompanied by compensatory behaviours that enhance foraging efficiency and increase the probability of encountering food .
However , the molecular details of how hunger triggers changes in the activity of neural circuits to elicit these adaptive behavioural outcomes remains to be resolved .
We show here that AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) regulates neuronal activity to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to acute starvation , and this effect is mediated by the coordinated modulation of glutamatergic inputs .
AMPK targets both the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 in one of the primary circuits that governs behavioural response to food availability in C . elegans .
Overall , our study suggests that AMPK acts as a molecular trigger in the specific starvation-sensitive neurons to modulate glutamatergic inputs and to elicit adaptive behavioural outputs in response to acute starvation .

When we're hungry, our bodies go into survival mode and we become more efficient at finding food. Scientists have been trying to figure out exactly how this works in our brains. They've discovered that a protein called AMPK plays a key role in regulating the activity of certain neurons that control our response to hunger. By targeting specific receptors in the brain, AMPK helps us adapt to and overcome the stress of starvation. This research was done using tiny worms, but it could have implications for understanding how hunger affects humans too.


219 Propagated infra-slow intrinsic brain activity reorganizes across wake and slow wave sleep

Propagation of slow intrinsic brain activity has been widely observed in electrophysiogical studies of slow wave sleep ( SWS ) .
However , in human resting state fMRI ( rs-fMRI ) , intrinsic activity has been understood predominantly in terms of zero-lag temporal synchrony ( functional connectivity ) within systems known as resting state networks ( RSNs ) .
Prior rs-fMRI studies have found that RSNs are generally preserved across wake and sleep .
Here , we use a recently developed analysis technique to study propagation of infra-slow intrinsic blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signals in normal adults during wake and SWS .
This analysis reveals marked changes in propagation patterns in SWS vs . wake .
Broadly , ordered propagation is preserved within traditionally defined RSNs but lost between RSNs .
Additionally , propagation between cerebral cortex and subcortical structures reverses directions , and intra-cortical propagation becomes reorganized , especially in visual and sensorimotor cortices .
These findings show that propagated rs-fMRI activity informs theoretical accounts of the neural functions of sleep .

Scientists have observed slow brain activity during deep sleep that spreads throughout the brain. More recently, they have used a special technique to study how this activity travels during both wakefulness and deep sleep in adults. The results show that the way the activity spreads changes significantly during deep sleep compared to wakefulness. The patterns of activity within certain brain networks stay the same, but the way these networks connect with each other and with other parts of the brain is different. These findings can help us better understand how the brain works during sleep.


220 Schematic memory components converge within angular gyrus during retrieval

Mental schemas form associative knowledge structures that can promote the encoding and consolidation of new and related information .
Schemas are facilitated by a distributed system that stores components separately , presumably in the form of inter-connected neocortical representations .
During retrieval , these components need to be recombined into one representation , but where exactly such recombination takes place is unclear .
Thus , we asked where different schema components are neuronally represented and converge during retrieval .
Subjects acquired and retrieved two well-controlled , rule-based schema structures during fMRI on consecutive days .
Schema retrieval was associated with midline , medial-temporal , and parietal processing .
We identified the multi-voxel representations of different schema components , which converged within the angular gyrus during retrieval .
Critically , convergence only happened after 24-hour-consolidation and during a transfer test where schema material was applied to novel but related trials .
Therefore , the angular gyrus appears to recombine consolidated schema components into one memory representation .

Our brains have a way of organizing information called schemas. These are like little libraries of related knowledge that help us remember and learn new things. Different parts of our brain store these bits of information separately, then bring them together when we try to retrieve a memory. Scientists wanted to know where this recombination happens in the brain. They had people learn two different sets of rules on different days while getting brain scans. They found that when people tried to remember these rules, different parts of their brain were active. They then found that one specific part of the brain, called the angular gyrus, brings all these separate pieces of knowledge together into a full memory. This only happens after the information has had time to "settle" in our brains for a day or more.


221 Siglec1-expressing subcapsular sinus macrophages provide soil for melanoma lymph node metastasis

Lymph nodes ( LNs ) are a common site of metastasis in solid cancers , and cutaneous melanomas show inherent properties of LN colonization .
However , interactions between LN stroma and pioneer metastatic cells during metastatic colonization remain largely uncharacterized .
Here we studied mice implanted with GFP-expressing melanoma cells to decipher early LN colonization events .
We show that Siglec1-expressing subcapsular sinus ( SCS ) macrophages provide anchorage to pioneer metastatic cells .
We performed in vitro co-culture to demonstrate that interactions between hypersialylated cancer cells and Siglec1 drive the proliferation of cancer cells .
When comparing the transcriptome profile of Siglec1-interacting cancer cells against non-Siglec1-interacting cancer cells , we detected enrichment in positive regulators of cell cycle progression .
Further , knockout of St3gal3 sialyltransferase compromised the metastatic efficiency of tumor cells by reducing α−2 , 3-linked sialylation .
Thus , the interaction between Siglec1-expressing SCS macrophages and pioneer metastatic cells drives cell cycle progression and enables efficient metastatic colonization .

When cancer spreads, it often ends up in the lymph nodes, which are tiny organs in our bodies that help fight infections. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cancer cells interact with the lymph nodes during this process. They did this by studying mice that had melanoma, a type of skin cancer. They found that a certain type of immune cell in the lymph nodes helped the cancer cells take root and grow. They also found that the cancer cells needed a certain type of molecule to attach to these immune cells. When the scientists blocked this molecule, the cancer cells were not able to spread as well. Understanding this process could help us develop new treatments for cancer in the future.


222 An excitatory cortical feedback loop gates retinal wave transmission in rodent thalamus

Spontaneous retinal waves are critical for the development of receptive fields in visual thalamus ( LGN ) and cortex ( VC ) .
Despite a detailed understanding of the circuit specializations in retina that generate waves , whether central circuit specializations also exist to control their propagation through visual pathways of the brain is unknown .
Here we identify a developmentally transient , corticothalamic amplification of retinal drive to thalamus as a mechanism for retinal wave transmission in the infant rat brain .
During the period of retinal waves , corticothalamic connections excite LGN , rather than driving feedforward inhibition as observed in the adult .
This creates an excitatory feedback loop that gates retinal wave transmission through the LGN .
This cortical multiplication of retinal wave input ends just prior to eye-opening , as cortex begins to inhibit LGN .
Our results show that the early retino-thalamo-cortical circuit uses developmentally specialized feedback amplification to ensure powerful , high-fidelity transmission of retinal activity despite immature connectivity .

We all know that our brain is responsible for processing what we see, but have you ever wondered how it develops this ability? Research has shown that when we are infants, there are special signals called retinal waves that help our brain build its visual system. These retinal waves are like a practice run for our brain to learn how to interpret what we see. Scientists have discovered that there is a part of our brain called the visual thalamus and cortex that are crucial in helping these signals get to where they need to go. In fact, they found that the cortex actually boosts the signals to make sure they get to the right place! This only happens when we are babies and stops right before we open our eyes for the first time. It's amazing to think about all the things that happen in our brain when we are learning to see!


223 Control of PNG kinase, a key regulator of mRNA translation, is coupled to meiosis completion at egg activation

The oocyte-to-embryo transition involves extensive changes in mRNA translation , regulated in Drosophila by the PNG kinase complex whose activity we show here to be under precise developmental control .
Despite presence of the catalytic PNG subunit and the PLU and GNU activating subunits in the mature oocyte , GNU is phosphorylated at Cyclin B/CDK1sites and unable to bind PNG and PLU .
In vitro phosphorylation of GNU by CyclinB/CDK1 blocks activation of PNG .
Meiotic completion promotes GNU dephosphorylation and PNG kinase activation to regulate translation .
The critical regulatory effect of phosphorylation is shown by replacement in the oocyte with a phosphorylation-resistant form of GNU , which promotes PNG-GNU complex formation , elevation of Cyclin B , and meiotic defects consistent with premature PNG activation .
After PNG activation GNU is destabilized , thus inactivating PNG .
This short-lived burst in kinase activity links development with maternal mRNA translation and ensures irreversibility of the oocyte-to-embryo transition .

This study looked at how a complex called PNG kinase helps control the process of a female egg becoming an embryo in fruit flies. The researchers found that the activity of this complex is controlled during development, and that phosphorylation – a type of chemical modification – plays a key role. When phosphorylated, a subunit called GNU cannot activate the complex and initiate the transition to an embryo. However, once the egg has completed meiosis – a key developmental step – GNU gets dephosphorylated and activates the complex to start translating maternal mRNA into proteins for the developing embryo. This burst of activity is important because it ensures that the egg irreversibly turns into an embryo and continues developing.


224 Changing the responses of cortical neurons from sub- to suprathreshold using single spikes in vivo

Action Potential ( APs ) patterns of sensory cortex neurons encode a variety of stimulus features , but how can a neuron change the feature to which it responds ?
Here , we show that in vivo a spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ) protocol—consisting of pairing a postsynaptic AP with visually driven presynaptic inputs—modifies a neurons' AP-response in a bidirectional way that depends on the relative AP-timing during pairing .
Whereas postsynaptic APs repeatedly following presynaptic activation can convert subthreshold into suprathreshold responses , APs repeatedly preceding presynaptic activation reduce AP responses to visual stimulation .
These changes were paralleled by restructuring of the neurons response to surround stimulus locations and membrane-potential time-course .
Computational simulations could reproduce the observed subthreshold voltage changes only when presynaptic temporal jitter was included .
Together this shows that STDP rules can modify output patterns of sensory neurons and the timing of single-APs plays a crucial role in sensory coding and plasticity .

This study looked at how neurons in the part of the brain that processes senses can change how they react to different things they sense. The researchers found that by using a certain kind of pattern of electrical signals, they could make the neurons either react more strongly or react less strongly to certain things they sense. This also changed how the neurons responded to things around them. Computer simulations showed that these changes only happened when the signals arrived at very specific times. These findings show that the brain can learn and adapt to new information over time.


225 Intrinsic disorder within AKAP79 fine-tunes anchored phosphatase activity toward substrates and drug sensitivity

Scaffolding the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase 2B ( PP2B , calcineurin ) focuses and insulates termination of local second messenger responses .
Conformational flexibility in regions of intrinsic disorder within A-kinase anchoring protein 79 ( AKAP79 ) delineates PP2B access to phosphoproteins .
Structural analysis by negative-stain electron microscopy ( EM ) reveals an ensemble of dormant AKAP79-PP2B configurations varying in particle length from 160 to 240 Å .
A short-linear interaction motif between residues 337–343 of AKAP79 is the sole PP2B-anchoring determinant sustaining these diverse topologies .
Activation with Ca2+/calmodulin engages additional interactive surfaces and condenses these conformational variants into a uniform population with mean length 178 ± 17 Å .
This includes a Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro sequence ( residues 125–128 of AKAP79 ) that occupies a binding pocket on PP2B utilized by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin .
Live-cell imaging with fluorescent activity-sensors infers that this region fine-tunes calcium responsiveness and drug sensitivity of the anchored phosphatase .

This study looked at how a protein called AKAP79 helps regulate a molecule called calcineurin, which is important in cell signaling. They found that the structure of AKAP79 can vary, but a specific sequence of amino acids helps anchor it to calcineurin. When calcineurin is activated, AKAP79 becomes more uniform in shape and more sensitive to calcium levels. Importantly, a drug called cyclosporin also interacts with this same sequence of amino acids, which could affect how the phosphatase is regulated. Overall, this study sheds light on how these proteins work together to control cellular responses.


226 Prediction of primary somatosensory neuron activity during active tactile exploration

Primary sensory neurons form the interface between world and brain .
Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but , under natural behaving conditions , sense organs are under active , motor control .
In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration , we recorded from primary mechanosensory neurons of awake , head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers , and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography .
Using Generalised Linear Models , we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by whisker angle , but well-predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion .
These results are in apparent contrast to previous studies of passive stimulation , but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions .
Thus , simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural , exploratory behaviour involving active movement of sense organs .

Our study investigated how sensory neurons work during active exploration, where the organism is moving and controlling their sense organs. We observed awake mice as they touched a pole with their whiskers and measured both the whisker movement and forces involved. Surprisingly, we found that the neurons responded better to rotational forces than whisker angle, which was in contrast to previous studies that looked at passive stimulation. However, this difference can be explained by the conditions of active exploration. Our findings show that even simple models can predict complex neural activity during natural, active exploration.


227 TORC2-Gad8-dependent myosin phosphorylation modulates regulation by calcium

Cells respond to changes in their environment through signaling networks that modulate cytoskeleton and membrane organization to coordinate cell-cycle progression , polarized cell growth and multicellular development .
Here , we define a novel regulatory mechanism by which the motor activity and function of the fission yeast type one myosin , Myo1 , is modulated by TORC2-signalling-dependent phosphorylation .
Phosphorylation of the conserved serine at position 742 ( S742 ) within the neck region changes both the conformation of the neck region and the interactions between Myo1 and its associating calmodulin light chains .
S742 phosphorylation thereby couples the calcium and TOR signaling networks that are involved in the modulation of myosin-1 dynamics to co-ordinate actin polymerization and membrane reorganization at sites of endocytosis and polarised cell growth in response to environmental and cell-cycle cues .

Our cells have a way of adapting to changes in their surroundings by using complex communication systems that coordinate their growth, development, and cell division. We have discovered a new way in which one of these systems, called TORC2 signaling, can affect the activity of a molecular motor called Myo1. This process involves adding a chemical modification, called phosphorylation, to a specific part of Myo1, which changes the way it interacts with other molecules and affects the shape of its structure. This modification helps cells respond to cues from their environment by coordinating the organization of their internal structures, such as the cytoskeleton and membranes, in a way that supports their growth and survival.


228 Sequence-dependent base pair stepping dynamics in XPD helicase unwinding

Helicases couple the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to directional translocation along nucleic acids and transient duplex separation .
Understanding helicase mechanism requires that the basic physicochemical process of base pair separation be understood .
This necessitates monitoring helicase activity directly , at high spatio-temporal resolution .
Using optical tweezers with single base pair ( bp ) resolution , we analyzed DNA unwinding by XPD helicase , a Superfamily 2 ( SF2 ) DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and transcription initiation .
We show that monomeric XPD unwinds duplex DNA in 1-bp steps , yet exhibits frequent backsteps and undergoes conformational transitions manifested in 5-bp backward and forward steps .
Quantifying the sequence dependence of XPD stepping dynamics with near base pair resolution , we provide the strongest and most direct evidence thus far that forward , single-base pair stepping of a helicase utilizes the spontaneous opening of the duplex .
The proposed unwinding mechanism may be a universal feature of DNA helicases that move along DNA phosphodiester backbones .

Helicases are enzymes that move along DNA and separate its strands. They use chemical energy from ATP to do this job. To understand how they work, we need to study the basic physics of how DNA strands separate. We did this by using powerful microscopes that can see individual base pairs of DNA. We looked at one type of helicase called XPD, which is important for fixing DNA and starting the process of reading its genetic code. We found that XPD moves along the DNA in steps of one base pair, but sometimes it takes steps backward or changes its shape. We also discovered that XPD uses the natural tendency of DNA strands to separate to move forward. This mechanism might be common to other helicases that move along strands of DNA.


229 Hexameric helicase G40P unwinds DNA in single base pair steps

Most replicative helicases are hexameric , ring-shaped motor proteins that translocate on and unwind DNA .
Despite extensive biochemical and structural investigations , how their translocation activity is utilized chemo-mechanically in DNA unwinding is poorly understood .
We examined DNA unwinding by G40P , a DnaB-family helicase , using a single-molecule fluorescence assay with a single base pair resolution .
The high-resolution assay revealed that G40P by itself is a very weak helicase that stalls at barriers as small as a single GC base pair and unwinds DNA with the step size of a single base pair .
Binding of a single ATPγS could stall unwinding , demonstrating highly coordinated ATP hydrolysis between six identical subunits .
We observed frequent slippage of the helicase , which is fully suppressed by the primase DnaG .
We anticipate that these findings allow a better understanding on the fine balance of thermal fluctuation activation and energy derived from hydrolysis .

In simple terms, this study looks at how certain proteins called helicases help unwind DNA and how they use energy to do so. We focused on one specific helicase called G40P and used a very precise tool to watch it work at the level of a single base pair. We found that it's not very good at its job on its own and can get stuck even on small bumps in the DNA. We also saw that it needs energy in the form of a molecule called ATP to work, and that all six parts of the G40P protein work together in a coordinated way. Lastly, we found that another protein called primase helps G40P work better. This new information teaches us more about how these proteins do their important work inside our cells.


230 Structure of substrate-bound SMG1-8-9 kinase complex reveals molecular basis for phosphorylation specificity

PI3K-related kinases ( PIKKs ) are large Serine/Threonine ( Ser/Thr ) -protein kinases central to the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes .
PIKK family member SMG1 orchestrates progression of an RNA quality control pathway , termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) , by phosphorylating the NMD factor UPF1 .
Phosphorylation of UPF1 occurs in its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions at Serine/Threonine-Glutamine ( SQ ) motifs .
How SMG1 and other PIKKs specifically recognize SQ motifs has remained unclear .
Here , we present a cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) reconstruction of a human SMG1-8-9 kinase complex bound to a UPF1 phosphorylation site at an overall resolution of 2 . 9 Å .
This structure provides the first snapshot of a human PIKK with a substrate-bound active site .
Together with biochemical assays , it rationalizes how SMG1 and perhaps other PIKKs specifically phosphorylate Ser/Thr-containing motifs with a glutamine residue at position +1 and a hydrophobic residue at position -1 , thus elucidating the molecular basis for phosphorylation site recognition .

A group of proteins called PI3K-related kinases play an important role in controlling many processes inside our cells. One of these proteins, SMG1, helps to move along a system that helps cells get rid of damaged RNA molecules. SMG1 does this by modifying another protein called UPF1. We now have a better understanding of how SMG1 recognizes and modifies UPF1. Using a special imaging technique, we were able to take a picture of SMG1 attached to UPF1 and see how they interact at a molecular level. This new information could help scientists develop better ways to target these proteins and treat diseases that involve them.


231 Long-distance communication by specialized cellular projections during pigment pattern development and evolution

Changes in gene activity are essential for evolutionary diversification .
Yet , elucidating the cellular behaviors that underlie modifications to adult form remains a profound challenge .
We use neural crest-derived adult pigmentation of zebrafish and pearl danio to uncover cellular bases for alternative pattern states .
We show that stripes in zebrafish require a novel class of thin , fast cellular projection to promote Delta-Notch signaling over long distances from cells of the xanthophore lineage to melanophores .
Projections depended on microfilaments and microtubules , exhibited meandering trajectories , and stabilized on target cells to which they delivered membraneous vesicles .
By contrast , the uniformly patterned pearl danio lacked such projections , concomitant with Colony stimulating factor 1-dependent changes in xanthophore differentiation that likely curtail signaling available to melanophores .
Our study reveals a novel mechanism of cellular communication , roles for differentiation state heterogeneity in pigment cell interactions , and an unanticipated morphogenetic behavior contributing to a striking difference in adult form .

In simpler terms, this article discusses how genes can cause changes in the way an animal looks as it grows up. The authors of this study looked at two types of fish with different patterns of color on their skin. They found that the striped fish had a new type of cell projection that helps signal to other cells far away, leading to the creation of stripes. The other fish, which had a more uniform color, did not have this type of projection and instead had changes in how certain cells developed, which affected how they interacted with other cells. Understanding how cells communicate and interact can help explain why animals look the way they do and how they evolved over time.


232 Collagen induces activation of DDR1 through lateral dimer association and phosphorylation between dimers

The collagen-binding receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 ( discoidin domain receptor 1 ) is a drug target for a wide range of human diseases , but the molecular mechanism of DDR1 activation is poorly defined .
Here we co-expressed different types of signalling-incompetent DDR1 mutants ( ‘receiver’ ) with functional DDR1 ( ‘donor’ ) and demonstrate phosphorylation of receiver DDR1 by donor DDR1 in response to collagen .
Making use of enforced covalent DDR1 dimerisation , which does not affect receptor function , we show that receiver dimers are phosphorylated in trans by the donor; this process requires the kinase activity of the donor but not that of the receiver .
The receiver ectodomain is not required , but phosphorylation in trans is abolished by mutation of the transmembrane domain .
Finally , we show that mutant DDR1 that cannot bind collagen is recruited into DDR1 signalling clusters .
Our results support an activation mechanism whereby collagen induces lateral association of DDR1 dimers and phosphorylation between dimers .

Scientists have discovered a new way to activate a receptor called DDR1, which is important for treating various human diseases. They found that when DDR1 is exposed to collagen, it can activate other forms of DDR1 and cause them to become phosphorylated, which is an important step in signal transduction. Even mutated forms of DDR1 that don't normally work can become activated in this way. This discovery could lead to new treatments for diseases that involve DDR1, like cancer or fibrosis.


233 A Phytophthora effector recruits a host cytoplasmic transacetylase into nuclear speckles to enhance plant susceptibility

Oomycete pathogens secrete host cell-entering effector proteins to manipulate host immunity during infection .
We previously showed that PsAvh52 , an early-induced RxLR effector secreted from the soybean root rot pathogen , Phytophthora sojae , could suppress plant immunity .
Here , we found that PsAvh52 is required for full virulence on soybean and binds to a novel soybean transacetylase , GmTAP1 , in vivo and in vitro .
PsAvh52 could cause GmTAP1 to relocate into the nucleus where GmTAP1 could acetylate histones H2A and H3 during early infection , thereby promoting susceptibility to P . sojae .
In the absence of PsAvh52 , GmTAP1 remained confined to the cytoplasm and did not modify plant susceptibility .
These results demonstrate that GmTAP1 is a susceptibility factor that is hijacked by PsAvh52 in order to promote epigenetic modifications that enhance the susceptibility of soybean to P . sojae infection .

Oomycete pathogens release proteins that invade host cells and weaken the plant's immune system during infection. One such protein, called PsAvh52, is secreted from the Phytophthora sojae pathogen and can suppress a soybean's immunity. The protein is important for the pathogen to cause damage to the soybean and works by binding to and harming a new soybean molecule called GmTAP1. This molecule, when modified by PsAvh52, can change how genes in the nucleus are modified, making the plant more susceptible to infection. When PsAvh52 is not present, GmTAP1 stays in the cell's outer area and the plant is not as susceptible to P. sojae. Overall, these findings show how the pathogen can exploit soybean plants and cause disruption to the plant's normal functions.


234 Primate TRIM5 proteins form hexagonal nets on HIV-1 capsids

TRIM5 proteins are restriction factors that block retroviral infections by binding viral capsids and preventing reverse transcription .
Capsid recognition is mediated by C-terminal domains on TRIM5α ( SPRY ) or TRIMCyp ( cyclophilin A ) , which interact weakly with capsids .
Efficient capsid recognition also requires the conserved N-terminal tripartite motifs ( TRIM ) , which mediate oligomerization and create avidity effects .
To characterize how TRIM5 proteins recognize viral capsids , we developed methods for isolating native recombinant TRIM5 proteins and purifying stable HIV-1 capsids .
Biochemical and EM analyses revealed that TRIM5 proteins assembled into hexagonal nets , both alone and on capsid surfaces .
These nets comprised open hexameric rings , with the SPRY domains centered on the edges and the B-box and RING domains at the vertices .
Thus , the principles of hexagonal TRIM5 assembly and capsid pattern recognition are conserved across primates , allowing TRIM5 assemblies to maintain the conformational plasticity necessary to recognize divergent and pleomorphic retroviral capsids .

TRIM5 proteins are important in protecting cells from certain viruses, by stopping them from multiplying. They work by recognising the virus's shape and latching onto it. Researchers have been studying how TRIM5 proteins interact with a virus called HIV-1. They found that the TRIM5 proteins form neat, hexagonal structures both on their own and when bound to the virus. These structures help the proteins recognise the virus and stop it in its tracks. This could help scientists develop new ways to fight retroviral infections.


235 A molecular model for the role of SYCP3 in meiotic chromosome organisation

The synaptonemal complex ( SC ) is an evolutionarily-conserved protein assembly that holds together homologous chromosomes during prophase of the first meiotic division .
Whilst essential for meiosis and fertility , the molecular structure of the SC has proved resistant to elucidation .
The SC protein SYCP3 has a crucial but poorly understood role in establishing the architecture of the meiotic chromosome .
Here we show that human SYCP3 forms a highly-elongated helical tetramer of 20 nm length .
N-terminal sequences extending from each end of the rod-like structure bind double-stranded DNA , enabling SYCP3 to link distant sites along the sister chromatid .
We further find that SYCP3 self-assembles into regular filamentous structures that resemble the known morphology of the SC lateral element .
Together , our data form the basis for a model in which SYCP3 binding and assembly on meiotic chromosomes leads to their organisation into compact structures compatible with recombination and crossover formation .

The synaptonemal complex is an important structure that holds our genetic material together during cell division. But scientists didn't quite understand how it worked, until now. They found that one of the key proteins involved, called SYCP3, forms a long and twisty shape that can bind to DNA and link up different parts of our chromosomes. SYCP3 also stacks together to form a filament that looks like the synaptonemal complex we knew about before. This discovery can help us understand how our genetic information is organized and allows for important changes to happen during cell division.


236 EGFR signaling promotes self-renewal through the establishment of cell polarity in Drosophila follicle stem cells

Epithelial stem cells divide asymmetrically , such that one daughter replenishes the stem cell pool and the other differentiates .
We found that , in the epithelial follicle stem cell ( FSC ) lineage of the Drosophila ovary , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling functions specifically in the FSCs to promote the unique partially polarized state of the FSC , establish apical–basal polarity throughout the lineage , and promote FSC maintenance in the niche .
In addition , we identified a novel connection between EGFR signaling and the cell-polarity regulator liver kinase B1 ( LKB1 ) , which indicates that EGFR signals through both the Ras–Raf–MEK–Erk pathway and through the LKB1–AMPK pathway to suppress apical identity .
The development of apical–basal polarity is the earliest visible difference between FSCs and their daughters , and our findings demonstrate that the EGFR-mediated regulation of apical–basal polarity is essential for the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates .

We studied how stem cells in the Drosophila ovary divide and stay healthy. We found that a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) helps these cells keep their shape and stay in their special spot, or "niche". We also discovered a new way in which EGFR controls these stem cells, by working with another protein called liver kinase B1 (LKB1). When EGFR and LKB1 work together, they make sure the stem cells keep their bottom on the ground and maintain their important stem cell characteristics. This helps these stem cells produce new stem cells and other specialized cells, and keeps the balance of cells just right.


237 Essential role of lncRNA binding for WDR5 maintenance of active chromatin and embryonic stem cell pluripotency

The WDR5 subunit of the MLL complex enforces active chromatin and can bind RNA; the relationship between these two activities is unclear .
Here we identify a RNA binding pocket on WDR5 , and discover a WDR5 mutant ( F266A ) that selectively abrogates RNA binding without affecting MLL complex assembly or catalytic activity .
Complementation in ESCs shows that WDR5 F266A mutant is unable to accumulate on chromatin , and is defective in gene activation , maintenance of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation , and ESC self renewal .
We identify a family of ESC messenger and lncRNAs that interact with wild type WDR5 but not F266A mutant , including several lncRNAs known to be important for ESC gene expression .
These results suggest that specific RNAs are integral inputs into the WDR5-MLL complex for maintenance of the active chromatin state and embryonic stem cell fates .

The WDR5 protein helps to control how our genes are turned on and off, and it can also attach to certain kinds of RNA. Researchers wanted to know how these two activities are related, and they found a specific pocket on WDR5 that allows it to bind RNA. They then identified a mutated version of WDR5 that can't attach to RNA, but still performs its other functions normally. When they tested this mutant protein in stem cells, they found that it was unable to activate important genes and maintain the cell's ability to divide. They also discovered that certain types of RNA only interact with the normal version of WDR5, indicating that the presence of this RNA is necessary for WDR5 to do its job properly. These findings suggest that RNA is important for controlling the way our genetic information is used in stem cells, which could be useful information for treating diseases and developing new therapies.


238 The effect of hybridization on transposable element accumulation in an undomesticated fungal species

Transposable elements ( TEs ) are mobile genetic elements that can profoundly impact the evolution of genomes and species .
A long-standing hypothesis suggests that hybridization could deregulate TEs and trigger their accumulation , although it received mixed support from studies mostly in plants and animals .
Here , we tested this hypothesis in fungi using incipient species of the undomesticated yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus .
Population genomic data revealed no signature of higher transposition in natural hybrids .
As we could not rule out the elimination of past transposition increase signatures by natural selection , we performed a laboratory evolution experiment on a panel of artificial hybrids to measure TE accumulation in the near absence of selection .
Changes in TE copy numbers were not predicted by the level of evolutionary divergence between the parents of a hybrid genotype .
Rather , they were highly dependent on the individual hybrid genotypes , showing that strong genotype-specific deterministic factors govern TE accumulation in yeast hybrids .

Transposable elements (TEs) are like genetic hitchhikers that can jump around and change the genetic makeup of an organism. Some scientists thought that when different species mix (hybridize), these TEs might get out of control and cause more genetic changes. But we did some experiments with a type of yeast and found that this might not be true. We looked at the DNA of wild yeast that had mixed in nature and found no evidence that TEs were jumping around more. Then, in the lab, we mixed yeast with different amounts of genetic differences and saw that the amount of TEs actually depended on the specific yeast individuals involved, rather than how different their genes were. This means that TEs are affected by more than just how different the parents are.


239 Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) prime the limb specific Shh enhancer for chromatin changes that balance histone acetylation mediated by E26 transformation-specific (ETS) factors

Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) expression in the limb bud organizing centre called the zone of polarizing activity is regulated by the ZRS enhancer .
Here , we examine in mouse and in a mouse limb-derived cell line the dynamic events that activate and restrict the spatial activity of the ZRS .
Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signalling in the distal limb primes the ZRS at early embryonic stages maintaining a poised , but inactive state broadly across the distal limb mesenchyme .
The E26 transformation-specific transcription factor , ETV4 , which is induced by FGF signalling and acts as a repressor of ZRS activity , interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and ensures that the poised ZRS remains transcriptionally inactive .
Conversely , GABPα , an activator of the ZRS , recruits p300 , which is associated with histone acetylation ( H3K27ac ) indicative of an active enhancer .
Hence , the primed but inactive state of the ZRS is induced by FGF signalling and in combination with balanced histone modification events establishes the restricted , active enhancer responsible for patterning the limb bud during development .

This study looked at how a specific gene called Sonic hedgehog is regulated in developing mouse limbs. The gene is important for organizing the limb into different parts. The researchers found that another gene called Fibroblast growth factor helps to keep Sonic hedgehog in an inactive state until it's needed. They also discovered that two different proteins, ETV4 and GABPα, control whether Sonic hedgehog is turned on or off. Overall, these findings help us understand how limbs develop properly.
